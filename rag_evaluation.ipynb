Crucially, in autarky, the relative price will equal the Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS) at the country's endowment point. The MRS represents how much of one good consumers are willing to give up for one more unit of the other good.\n","\n","2.  **World Prices (After Opening to Trade):**\n","\n","*   When the country opens to trade, it faces *world prices* for chickens and soccer balls.  Let's say the world price of chickens relative to soccer balls is denoted as pT.\n","\n","3.  **The Decision Rule:**\n","\n","*   **Compare pT to the autarky MRS:**\n","\n","    *   **If pT > MRS:** This means the world price of chickens (relative to soccer balls) is *higher* than what it was domestically. The country can get more soccer balls for each chicken on the world market than it could before. This implies that the country will export chickens and import soccer balls.\n","    *   **If pT < MRS:** This means the world price of chickens (relative to soccer balls) is *lower* than what it was domestically. The country can get fewer soccer balls for each chicken on the world market than it could before. This implies that the country will export soccer balls and import chickens.\n","\n","4.  **Gains from Trade**\n","\n","*   The country gains from trade because it can consume outside of its production possibilities frontier by trading at world prices. This allows consumers to reach a higher indifference curve, therefore increasing overall welfare.\n","\n","**In simpler terms:**\n","\n","The country will export the good that is *relatively* cheaper to produce domestically compared to the rest of the world. Conversely, it will import the good that is *relatively* more expensive to produce domestically compared to the rest of the world. This is driven by differences between domestic (autarky) relative prices and world relative prices.\n","\n","**Important Considerations and Context from the Lectures:**\n","\n","*   **Endowments and Comparative Advantage:** The autarky prices are determined by the country's endowments (fixed amounts of Cloth and Food, or in this case, Chickens and Soccer Balls) and the consumer's preferences. The country will have a *comparative advantage* in producing the good that it can produce at a relatively lower opportunity cost (i.e., giving up less of the other good) compared to other countries.\n","*   **Gravity Equation:** While not directly related to the import/export decision in this simple model, the gravity equation reminds us that factors like country size (GDP) and distance to trading partners also influence trade flows.  This comes into play *after* the decision to import/export is made, influencing *how much* is traded.\n","*   **Trade Policy:** The material on trade policy (tariffs, subsidies) is relevant *after* the country opens to trade and wants to influence trade flows. The basic import/export decision is made *before* considering policy interventions.\n","\n","Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!\n","\n"]}]}]}
