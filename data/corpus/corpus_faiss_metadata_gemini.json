It is written specifically for courses and students who have completed a half-year course in intermediate microeconomic theory, a year of university calculus, and hopefully a half-year course in econometrics. The book is not suited to a course which covers both international trade and finance in one semester or quarter, nor is it suited to a course for non-majors. The book also serves as a basic text for master\u2122s courses in international economics or business and can in fact be used as a basic reference in higher-level courses before students plunge into journal articles. Our interest in producing such a book stems from the fact that virtually all alternative texts are not designed for a semester course in trade for economics majors with an intermediate microeconomics prerequisite. Available competing books generally try to serve combined trade- and-finance survey courses, either for non-economics majors or for students without the necessary microeconomic training.

Available competing books generally try to serve combined trade- and-finance survey courses, either for non-economics majors or for students without the necessary microeconomic training. As a result, they present watered-down theory with sometimes uneven analytical approaches. Further, such books do not offer deep coverage of important and informative empirical studies in the professional literature. Thus, our book is aimed at the upper end of the undergraduate and master\u2122s markets, using a more specialized and consistent approach. Using tools of geometry and calculus, we try to stay true to the great strength of international trade theory, which is its general-equilibrium approach to all issues. Competing books have adopted a clear trend toward partial-equilibrium representations of inherently general-equilibrium problems. Even worse is the regrettable use of partial-equilibrium \ufb01triangles\ufb02 to try to teach welfare analysis in trade. We also discuss analytically the most significant empirical studies that inform and flesh out the essential trade theory. We think that this combination of consistent theory supplemented by solid and frontier empirical evidence establishes the volume\u2122s unique contribution to international trade texts.

We think that this combination of consistent theory supplemented by solid and frontier empirical evidence establishes the volume\u2122s unique contribution to international trade texts. Our approach to trade theory and empirical work embodies a philosophy and pedagogy that helps unify the subject and the analysis. We have long maintained that there are many things that cause trade. Furthermore, these underlying causes or \ufb01bases\ufb02 for trade are not competing theories in the usual sense, but rather all of them operate to varying degrees at the same time in all countries. We believe that the task of theory is to analyze each cause individually and then understand the consequences of changes in the economic or policy environment surrounding each basis for trade. For example, a tariff can ha ve very different effects if the underlying cause of trade is differences in factor endowments in a perfectly competitive environment, versus one in which the cause of trade is scale economies and imperfect competition and countries are virtually identical. We argue that one role for positive empirical analysis is to examine the importance of alternative bases for trade and to examine which"

We argue that one role for positive empirical analysis is to examine the importance of alternative bases for trade and to examine which models have assumptions that conform better to real-world data. Armed with both theory and this empirical evidence, applied economists are then better positioned to assess counter-factual questions about policy and to make recommendations with some degree of confidence ra ther than from a stance of mere ideology. It is all too easy for us to say to politicians and journalists that liberalization is always and everywhere a good thing. But theory tells us that this is clearly not the case, and both theory and [PAGE 11] 2 empirical testing of the alternative models and assumptions help us give better advice.

We have tried to maintain a uniform level of analysis throughout the book, and the same basic \"tool kit\" is used repeatedly to avoid the costs of developing and learning new analytical constr uctions for each new topic. One of our first tasks was to develop a standard notation that can be used throughout the book and this notation sheet is attached after the outline. Our perception of standard texts is that they tend to treat one topic on a fairly formal level, such as the Heckscher-Ohlin model, and then resort to chat and anecdote about other topics, such as the industrial-organization approach to trade. We worked hard to develop analyses of quite different topics at approximately the same analytical level and depth of presentation. At the same time, we try to avoid introducing an analytical construction that requires a lot of time to master but is used only once.

We develop, for example, the \ufb01revealed preference\ufb02 methodology for assessing income and welfare changes that is used repeatedly throughout the book for evaluating the efficiency of production, gains from trade, the effects of dist ortions, and so forth. Chapter 4 ends with a (optional) section about the methodology for actually solving complex general-equilibrium models, about which we will say more below. Chapter 5 presents a general and thorough analysis of gains from trade. Not only do we analyze the aggregate gains for one country (this is done in all textbooks, though rarely with proper care) , but we also discuss the division of total gains between countries, and the distribution of one country\u2122s gains among groups within the country.

As noted above, our view is that many things can cause trade. So we begin in chapter 6 with what we call the \ufb01no trade model\ufb02. What would have to be true for countries to choose not to trade and for there to be no gains from trade? The resulting list of conditions then becomes the outline for the following chapters in which those restrictions are relaxed one at a time. Trade costs have attracted a great deal of attention in the last decade or two, and in appr eciation of this we will discuss how trade costs modify the results of each theoretical approach (e.g., factor-price equalization in the Heckscher- Ohlin model). Following the theory in each chapter, we present econometric evidence on that theory and evidence from a few numerical simulation models where appropriate.

Classical topics are covered in the chapter 15 on trade in factors of production while chapter 17 focuses on recent work on fragmentation: the expansion of trade at the extensive margin with new intermediate goods and services becoming tradeable. Chapter 16 has a significantly expanded and more analytical treatment of multinational firms and direct foreign investment, topics that have achieved the status of a major theoretical and empirical sub-field. The fourth part, chapters 18-23, turns to trade policy, with analyses of alternative instruments (tariffs, quotas, subsidies) grounded in the theory and evidence presented in earlier chapters.

These include the formation and impacts of preferential trade areas, the political economy underlying the selection of domestic and international trade policies, and the role of multilateralism in trade agreements. [PAGE 12] 3 Appendices to the book are motivated by a widespread frustration with the limitations of analytical techniques for all but extremely simple general-equilibrium models. Many books present analytical theory under the assumption of two goods, two countries, two factors, and zero trade costs. In the case of industrial-organiza tion models, there are often only one factor, a zero income elasticity of demand for the increasing-returns sector, and various partial-equilibrium assumptions. Empirical researchers take these simple approaches and apply their insights to multi-good, multi-country, multi-factor trade data generated in a world with multiple tariffs, transport costs, non-tariff barriers, and a host of dom estic distortions. It is not always clear that the simpler theoretical specifications are consistent with such complex data generation. Because of this tension and especially because of the limitations of analytical theory, we have decided to include some brief appendices outlining"

It is not always clear that the simpler theoretical specifications are consistent with such complex data generation. Because of this tension and especially because of the limitations of analytical theory, we have decided to include some brief appendices outlining the techniques for the numerical simulation of theoretical models, but do not feel that we should extend this into the calibration of models to actual data for policy-analysis experiments. Markusen has had long experience with teaching these techniques, and feels that he can open up a world of possibilities for students in a relatively sparse number of pages. Professors, if they wish, can make assignment to students to use these simple models to run counter-factual experiments (e.g., trade liberalization) and interpret the results in light of theory.

Often, we had to begin anew when a plan arrived at a possible confusion such as the use of same letter to denote a variable and an index, even though this is not technically an inconsistency. For example, it is common to use \ufb01C\ufb02 (upper case, lower case, subscript, superscript) to denote \ufb01consumption\ufb02, \ufb01country\ufb02 and \ufb01cost\ufb02, something we very much want to avoid. While many letters of the Roman and Greek alphabet are not drafted into service, we worked from the principle that notation should be intuitive if possible or at least not counter- intuitive and consistent if possible with common practice. In the end and largely in pursuit of generality, we abandon some of the \ufb01classic\ufb02 notation that many professors grew up on if not actually love. Instead of goods X and Y and factors of production K and L with prices r and w, we have chosen to adopt more general notation that permits us to refer to an arbitrary good, factor or price.

The approach we adopt is similar to that taken in more \ufb01modern classics\ufb02 such as Dixit and Norman (1980) and Woodland (1980). When we teach from the book, we use our lectures rather than the book to inject specific examples to add concrete relevance to the general cases of the book, such as translating factors V 1 and V 2 into capital and labor, or skilled and unskilled labor.

Examples from global economics are found in the news everyd ay. A decision by American policymakers to subsidize the production of ethanol, a form of gasoline containing an additive produced from corn, is seen by many as a key reason that grain prices are high around the world. The spectacular emergence of China as a major exporter of manufactured goods has affected wages in both rich and poor countries. As large corporations, such as Microsoft, Intel, Toyota , General Electric, and Siemens have expanded their investments in affiliates in many nations around th e world, they have built global production networks that share technological knowledge across locations to produce increasingly complex goods that could be sold anywhere.

The initial task is to design the suit, a highly creative activity that generally takes place in the headquarters of a major f ashion label, such as Armani or Hugo Boss. Beyond that, the firm must locate reliable suppliers of raw wool, which could be farmers in New Zealand, Argentina, Scotland, or elsewhere. The wool needs to be spun into yarn and then woven into finished fabrics, tasks that are likely to be done in low- wage economies with abundant labor, such as Vietnam or Bangladesh, both major centers of fabric manufacture.

To begin this journey, consider how modern-day globalization came about. 1.2Sources of Globalization The concept of globalization has numerous defi nitions, depending on the subject matter being explained. To international economists it has a simp le definition, albeit one with powerful implications. Specifically, globalization occurs when the markets of different countries become mo re integrated and interconnected through economic transactions that cr oss national borders. These transactions can be in real merchandise, various forms of services, financial instruments, investments in local production facilities by mu ltinational firms (a process called foreign direct investment, or FDI), temporary and permanent labor migration, and technological informa tion. They can involve individuals, trade between unrelated firms, transactions within internationa l enterprises, and governments.

It is useful to distinguish among the sources of globalization, the channels through which transactions occur, and the effects such integration seems to have on national economies. Consider first the sources: what causes economies to become more in tegrated over time? Economists generally focus on three major factors, all of which have been importa nt in spurring more interconnected global markets in the last 60 years. An obvious first factor is that countries have chosen to become more integrated through successively reducing their restrictions on internationa l trade in goods and services and barriers to foreign investment. Beginning in the late 1940s, a small numbe r of richer countries began jointly to bring down their taxes on imports, called tariffs, through negotiati on and renegotiations of a treaty called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 2 This process continued through nearly five decades until 1994 when"

Currently the WTO memb ership comprises nearly every country in the world and each member must commit to limits on its tariffs while engaging in periodic negotiations to reduce trad e restrictions. The GATT and WTO also were instrumental in liberalizing various quantitative ba rriers to trade, such as import quotas and favoritism in government procurement programs. More recently, WTO memb er countries have be gun opening their markets to international suppliers of particular services, such as transportation, retailing, insurance, and banking. Even more, both developed and many devel oping nations have greatly liberalized their rules under which international enterprises are permitted to invest in their markets.

Others did so under pressure from internati onal institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which often attach their lending programs to economic liberalization and trade reforms. Yet another major force toward lower trad e restrictions is the proliferation in the 1990s and 2000s of regional preferential trade accords, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement involving the United States, Canada and Mexico, and MERCO SUR, involving Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. These agreements generally eliminate ta riffs on trade within the region and also require relaxation of specific investment barriers.

There are the within-exporter surface transportation costs by railroad or truck to ocean port facilities or airpor ts. These costs have fallen considerably in countries that invested in roads and other transport infrastructur e. Similarly, the efficiency of the transit ports, whether by sea or air, matters considerably for shippi ng costs. The increasing use of large containers for shipping massive quantities packed tightly has increased this efficiency and encouraged mo re trade by ocean vessel. Similarly, the powerful jet engines on today\u2122s large cargo jets make it capable to ship considerable quantities of goods through the air, especia lly those products where rapid delivery is crucial..

It is interesting to note that the cost savings from containerization have been considerably offset by limited competition a nd high charges in the shipping industry over the last few decades. 4 As a result, a far larger share of world tr ade now takes place via air freight than was the case 20 years ago, meaning in turn that the speed at which goods are traded has increased considerably. Shipping costs also depend on access to loans from banks, called trade credits, which are used to pay the short-term charges and then repaid after exporting concerns are paid for the goods they send to importing firms. In the global credit crunch that emerged in 2008 and 2009, the volume of trade credits fell sharply, diminishing what was already a significant decline in foreign trade.

Reductions in shipping costs are an example of the third great source of globalization, changes in technologies that bind international economies closer together. Examples surround us every day.

The same is true for firms looking for high-quality industrial inputs and supplies, which use comp lex business-to-business info rmation networks to locate global sources. Important technological improvements also a rrive from sources far beyond telecommunications and software. Companies continually invest in research and development (R&D) to improve the quality of their products and make them more distinctive. Just as consumers like to choose from a greater range of products made within their home economies, th ey enjoy more variety from international product differentiation and quality improvements.

Similarly, manufacturing firms and service providers find their costs reduced, or profits increased, as they take advantage of better and mo re distinctive input supplies from multiple global sources. Consider, for example, the construction of a Boeing 747 passenger aircraft. To assemble this plane Boeing procures inputs from over 200 suppliers of materials, components, airframe systems, avionics, engines, power systems, and production equipment, with many of these companies headquartered in different nations. All are enga ged in R&D programs to develop new products, as is Boeing.

Just the opposite is true in mo st developing economies, where local services are cheap due to low wages and land prices. In these economies the PPP rate adjusts the per-capita GNI upward.

Continuing with Table 1.1, the fourth and fifth data columns show mercha ndise trade, which is the sum of all commodity exports plus imports, divided by GDP. This is a common m easure of \ufb01openness\ufb02 to international trade, for it indicates how important international trade is relative to the size of the economy. In general, countries that lower their trade barriers would expect to see this ratio rise over time, though there are many other determinants of the relative size of international trade exposure. These figures demonstrate that for most countries the last three decades have been a period of substantial growth in the importance of international trade.

In Canada this ratio rose from 48 to 61 percen t. The difference in these two countries is easily explained in terms of market size , which is a key factor in explaining trade volumes. Canada is a mu ch smaller economy than is the United States. Smaller economies tend to rely more on exports to support production and imports to provide c onsumption varieties, while larger economies are more diverse. As might be expected, the United States is Canada\u2122s la rgest trade partner and the sheer size of the U.S. economy supports significant amounts of Canadian trade. This situation holds also for Mexico, which saw its ratio of trade to GDP rise by a factor of 2. 7 in this period.

Although the UK trade share fell in this period, in Germany it rose from 48 percent to 72 percent. This increase reflects in part the close proximity of that country to its major trading partners in the European Union. Thus, distance from markets is another important determinant of international trade prominence. We can see this factor again in Japan , which is a large economy but its significant distance from major markets in North America and Europe imply relatively small trade shares. Australia\u2122s trade is also strongly affected by large distances.

More recently, members of the European Union have agreed to liberalize restrictions on immigration from anywhere within the EU, resulting in large inflows to the wea lthier nations.

Similarly in Europe: if investors in Italy were prevented from using brokers in Switzerland the financial sector would be fragmen ted and unproductive rather than concentrated and efficient. Indeed, this simple but powerful c oncept of specialization is the foundation on which international economists build their essential claim: globalization tends to raise aggregate incomes and overall living standards in all countries. Countri es become more productive because they concentrate their production in areas of true advantage. As we shall see in the text, there are numerous other reasons why we might generally expect globalization to generate aggregate benefits to a c ountry that embraces open trade.

Similarly, domestic enterprise gain access to a wider variety and quality range of inputs they can put into their production processes, thereby raising productivity. Second, globalization expands the size of market s into which domestic producers can sell their goods as exports, giving them more opportunities to benefit. A recent study of the impacts of Vietnam\u2122s 1993 decision to eliminate its restrictions on expor ting rice found substantial income gains for that country\u2122s rice producers, with a significant reduction in rural poverty and reduction in the use of child labor. 13 Third, foreign competition often breaks down inefficient domestic monopolies, bringing prices down closer to the cost of production and making consumers better off. 14 For example, in numerous developing countries the decision in the 1990s to open their telecommunications industries to international entry has dramatically expanded the ra"

A related outcome is that greater exposure to global competiti on often forces inefficient domestic firms to reduce their output or even shut down if they cannot invest sufficiently in greater productivity to compete. Economists think of this rationalization of production as a benefit, for it releases labor and capital from inefficient use into more productive firms or new investments. 15 It is the globalization equivalent to the familiar concept of creative destruction through comp etition and innovation. A further form of significant gains from globalization arrives from the information content of imports, FDI and licensing.

The most obvious winners are the migrants themselves, who typically make far higher incomes in the countries to which they move, such as the United States and Germany, than they could at home in Mexico, Central America, Africa and South Asia. 17 These migrants send billions of dollars or euros back to their home families in the form of remittances , which form a major source of income there and help poor households save and accumulate productive assets.

For example, trade and tec hnological change can have substantial effects on the distribution of income across types of workers, regions within countries, and across countries. In general, openness favors workers, land and capital that are cap able of producing high-quality goods for export. It tends to worsen the lot of individuals and regions that produce goods and services competing closely with imports, inward FDI, and immigrants.

A country or village, for example, may find its culture being changed to be more like interna tional practices that appeal to the bulk of consumers but are disliked by some. Thus, France and Canada have specific policies in place to prevent foreign media such as Hollywood movies and American television programs from overwhelming their cultural industries.

Perhaps more relevant is the economic contagion that is associated with financial crises. The global downturn of 2008-2009 was launched by the bursting of the housing bubble in the United States but diffused rapidly into the rest of the world through integrated investment markets. Finally, countries may worry that globalization pressures governments to choose policies that are not necessarily perceived to be in the national interest. Such changes may be mandated by the rules of the World Trade Organizati on or other international institutions, for example. Or they may be adopted by governments competitively in order to attract multinational enterprises looking to reduce production costs.

These are powerful objections to the idea that free trade is the most beneficial policy a country can pursue. They underlie the fact that, even though economists overwhelmingly prefer open markets, other people are reluctant to embrace that idea and sometimes actively oppose it. For instance, consider the following question asked in a Wall Street Journal poll late in 2007: \ufb01Do you think the fact that the U.S. economy has become increasingly global is good because it has opened up new markets for American products and resulted in more jobs, or bad because it has subjected American comp anies and employees to unfair comp etition and cheap labor?\ufb02 [PAGE 31] 14 23 \ufb01Americans\u2122 Anti-Global Turn May Stir Race for President,\ufb02 Wall Street Journal December 20, 2007. 24 For detailed discussion, see World Bank (2002) and Bordo, Taylor and Williamson (2003). 25 Immigration data are from Migration Policy Institute.

In this context, we might wonder whether recent globalization is sustainable or might actually be reversed as political pressures mount against it. To cons ider this question it is interesting to delve into a bit of history. The current era of rapid interna tional integration is unprecedented in its scale and scope, primarily because of the role of information technologies and the entry of vast new populations from China, India and other developing economies into globa l competition.

One effect was a steady d ecline in crop prices and farm incomes in Europe, pushing rural workers off the land.

Many of them migrated across the ocean. Further, the abundant land in North America and Au stralia attracted large capital flows from Europe to finance the construction of railr oads, ports, and factories. These flows were sizeable in every dimension. Thus, for example, by 1910 the ratio of world merchandise exports to global output reached about 35 percent, approximately the same as it is today. The foreign capital stock mounted to nearly nine pe rcent of GDP of the then-developing economies, such as the United States, Canada, and Australia. And th e number of immigrants who became legal permanent residents in the United States averaged nearly 1 million persons per year in the decade 1905-1914, peaking at 1,285,349 in 1907. 25 These figures are quite comparable to the approximately 1 million new legal residents per year since 2000, but represented a far-higher proportion of the labor force in the early 20 th century.

Thus, the period 1870-1915 was also a remarkable era of globalization, with similar effects: rising incomes overall, rapidly increasing inequality, particul arly harming the unskilled workers in Europe, and a shift of manufacturing capacity from high-wage to lo w-wage locations. This epoch was critical for the industrial development of th e United States and Canada. [PAGE 32] 15 26 See Kindleberger (1973) for an insightful history. 27 These trends are documented by an associa tion called Global Trade Alert, with udpates available at http://www.globaltradealert.org. However, this first wave was rapidly reversed after 1915 and subsequen tly global integration collapsed. By 1932 world exports had fallen to just fi ve percent of GDP, while legal immigration into the United States collapsed to just 23,068 persons in 1933. The reasons were straightforward.

World War I (1914-1918) greatly disrupted normal trade relations and many of the European economies never really recovered in the 1920s. The onset of the Great Depression of the early 1930s induced massive increases in barriers to trade, investment and migration. The mo st notorious episode was the passage into law in the United States of the Tariff Act of 1930, widely known as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. This bill sharply raised tariffs on 200,000 imported goods as the Unite d States attempted to push rising unemployment onto foreign labor markets. Other major trading part ners quickly retaliated with their own tariff increases, a process that some think contributed markedly to bringing on global depression. 26 At the same time, major countries greatly restricted the number of visas available for migration. Protectionism was the watchword of the day, with declining integration the result. This was a lesson painfully learned. After World War II (1938-1945), several countries in Western Europe joined the now-developed United States, Canada, Australia and other economies to establish a global system for integration that might pr eclude another episode like it."

After World War II (1938-1945), several countries in Western Europe joined the now-developed United States, Canada, Australia and other economies to establish a global system for integration that might pr eclude another episode like it. Thus was established the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and, most significantly for this course, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which became the World Trade Organization in 1995. The GATT engineered several rounds of tariff cuts among the developed countries and reduced some barriers to investment flows. Under this cooperative appro ach trade and investment again expanded, generating the Second Wave of globalization from 1950 to 1980, although the figures were modest compared to those in the current Third Wave. Given this history, can modern globalization be reversed? Much depends on how politicians react to the economic downturn of 2008-2010, th e impacts of higher unemployment, and popular resentment of income inequality.

By 2009 there we re unmistakable signs of an increasing tendency toward protectionism, including higher tariffs in many developing economies, government purchasing laws that favored domestic production, and restrictions on the ability of international firms to take over domestic enterprises in particular countries. 27 Perhaps the most worrying sign is the chronic inability of the WTO member countries to conclude the l ong-standing Doha Round of trade negotiations. At the same time, there are three major differences in the world of today compared to that of the early 20 th century, all of which argue that globalization is sustainable. First, modern globalization is, for the first time, truly global. With the exception of parts of sub-Saharan Africa, most of the developing world has engineered significant trade and investment liberalization. As a result their economies have become more dependent on export markets and importe d technologies. This global integration makes it less likely that countries will reverse course.

As a result, they are more likely to oppose protectionism than support it, for politi cal attempts to preserve jobs in one country are likely to raise costs of operations in others. Finally, virtually all nations of the world are members of the WTO, which places restrictions on their ability to raise trade and investment barriers unilaterally, as we [PAGE 33] 16 discuss in Chapter 24. Unless that institution collapses there is unlikely to be a significant reversal into protectionism. 1.6Summary With this background, we begin our exploration of international tr ade theory and policy.

These varying abilities are in turn related to underlying aspects of production, such as technologies, factor endowment s, competitive conditions, government taxes and subsidies, and returns to scale. However, other asp ects of technologies, mo st notably increasing returns to scale, can create trade and gains fro m trade for even identical economies. An understanding of these considerations will ultimately help us to understand why the US, for example, exports aircraft and cereal grains, and imports clothing. These same c onsiderations will he lp us understand the consequences of trade, including overall welfare gains and the distri bution of those gains between the memb ers of a society. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the basic building blocks from production theory that will be used repeatedly in subsequent chapters, so your investment in time now will pay handsomely throughout.

Let X denote a particular good, and let two factor s of production, such as capital and labor, be denoted by V 1 and V 2 . A basic building block of the supply side of our model will be the production function, as represented by equation 2.1: (2.1) where is some scaling parameter. This production func tion is characterized by a number of properties that will used repeatedly throughout the book. These are as follows: (A) Total factor productivity. This refers to the amount of output that can be produced from a given supply of inputs. While productivity is of course buried in the function F( ) itself, we will represent total factor productivity in 2.1 by the parameter : higher values of indicate higher total factor productivity.

We shall not have too much to say about the latter in this book. (B) Returns to scale. The term returns to scale indicates how output X responds to an equi- proportionate change in the input of all factors together. For example, how does output change if we double the inputs of all factors. If output exactly doubles, this is referred to as constant returns to scale. If output more than doubles, we call this increasing returns to scale. We will focus on these two cases throughout the book. Consider the following special cases of (2.1) in which"

Production functions which display a diminishing marginal rate of substitution typically also display diminishing marginal products of each factor: increasing the input of one factor holding the other factor constant increases output at a diminishing rate. So, for example, if we increase the input of factor 1 holding factor 2 constant, the first partial derivative (marginal product MP 1 ) holding V 2 constant and second partial derivative of the Cobb-Douglas function are as follows: [PAGE 44] 3 (2.6) where the second partial is negative since ( - 1) < 0.

It can refer the fact that for a certain maximization problem (maximize profits) there is an equivalent minimization problem (minimize costs), or it can refer to a change of variables or functions that carry the same information, such as switching from a production function defined over input quantities to a cost function defined over input prices.

We begin with the standard Marshallian representation of th e consumer\u2122s optimization problem: maximizing utility subject to a budget constraint gives us demand as a function of prices and income. Then we analyze the Hicksian approach: minimizing expenditure subject to a target utility level gives us demand as a function of prices and utility. Then we turn to the questi on of aggregating individua l demands into aggregate demand and note that extremely restrictive assump tions are needed in order to make this theoretically valid. But having made note of this, we will then fo llow the tradition of trade theory and more or less ignore this problem in what follows.

Relatively simple discussions of aggregation can be found in Green (1976) or Deaton and Muellbauer (1980). 2. In other texts, you may see the assump tion that preferences are homothetic rather than homogeneous. The assumption that a function is homothetic is a somewhat weaker assumption than assuming it is homogeneous. Specifically, any monot onic transformation of a homogenous function is homothetic. Since for preferences we only require tast es to have the property that more is preferred to less, without really caring by how much more it is preferred, the weaker and mo re general homothetic property is sufficient for mo st results in consumer theo ry.

This section considers ge neral-equilibrium in a closed economy; that is, an economy that is self sufficient and does not trade. Such an economy is said to be in autarky . We will begin with an informal, graphical repr esentation of general equ ilibrium, and move later in the chapter to a more rigorous formulation. Th ree sets conditions determine general-equilibrium in a closed economy. The first of these are optimization conditions for producers and consumers. Throughout this chapter producers and consumers are assumed to be competitive. In later chapters we will consider many cases of imperfect competition and other distortions.

The first two optimization conditi ons mentioned in the previous section remain unchanged. The only difference is that the values of world prices will in general be different from the values of the prices determined in autarky. The difference between the closed and open econom y equilibria lies in the third condition: market clearing. With international trade, an economy is no longer constrained to consume only what it can produce itself. The loosening of this constraint is indeed the source of gains from trade as we shall see. A trading economy is able to sell some of one good at world prices and use the proceeds to buy the other commodity.

The substitution effect here is always negative: an increase in the price of a good decreases demand and increases production, so M i = D i - X i is negatively related to the relative price of p i . However, the income effect is more complicated than in the standard consumer problem (even under the assumption that all goods are normal).

Intuitively, as the price of the export good con tinues to increase, the country gets richer from the sales of that good. This leads consumers to want to devote some of their additional income to purchases of that good. Thus at some point, this \"income e ffect\", which leads consumers to demand more of the export good, may outweigh the substitution effect whic h leads consumers to want less of a good when its price rises. Finally, movement along the excess demand curve away from p a in either direction is welfare improving because any change in price leads to an increase in the consumption choices for consumers.

The modern approach to general-equilibrium is to formulate a system of equations and inequalities, embedding the optimization at the level of the industry and household, creating a system of n weak inequalities in n unknowns. General equilibrium is then a solution to a square system, not a solution to a single constrained optimization problem. It is actually a bit more complicated than that.

While the above system seems simple and intuitive, in many applied problems it turns out to be more useful to work with Hicksian demand and to model utility as though it was a produced good: utility ( U ) is produced with inputs of X 1 and X 2 , and it has a price associated with it, p u , which in equilibrium must be the cost of producing one unit of utility , th e unit expenditure function. One advantage of this approach is that welfare and the real consumer price index p u (the price of a unit of utility) are automatically computed as part of the solution. The same model as above can be written as follows.

Trade can be thought of as removing a constraint : the requirement that anything that is consumed must be produced domestically. Trade can be thought of as creating an opportunity : the ability to essentially transform one good into another by exporting the first and importing the second.

In the two- good case, Walras\u2122 law allows us to find equilibrium in one market only, then the other market must clear as well. The world prices (or just price ratio in the two- good case) is then determined as the price ratio at which the sum of all country\u2122 s excess demands are zero. In the two-country case, the import demand of one country must balance the exports (negative ex cess demand) of the other country. The world price ratio must lie between the two autarky price ra tios, and each country will export the good it produces relatively cheaply in autarky and import the good which is relatively costly in autarky.

This is largely due to the fact that we generally cannot characterize much about the production frontier other than concavity from knowing sectoral production functions. Even in the two-good, two-factor case, the graphical and analytical approaches can say little quantitatively; e.g., what are the aggregate welfare and distributional effects of at 20% import tariff? On account of these difficulties, we have sketched the outline of a methodology used to solve for general equilibrium in more complex situations. This methodology embeds the optimization problems at the sectoral level, that of industries and households .

In a dynamic model with many time periods, trade need not balance in any one time period. A country can consume more than it producers by selling assets which can be thought of as claims to future consumption. The United States has been in a position of trade deficit for years, indicating that foreigners are accumulating US assets and hence have a claim on futu re US production.

An astute reader might note below that both the export and import equation can hold with equality for a given good. It is possible that a good could be both imported and exported, with only net trade being determined in equilibrium (there are infi nitely many gross trade patterns consistent with a given net trade). This indeterminacy is broken in numerical models by imposing a very small trade cost (0.01% will do). For example, equation (4.25) below could be written .

Returning to a point made in the first paragraph of this section, it also follows that two countries mutually enjoy gains from trade.

The proof of production efficient in Chapter 2 is valid. For a good produced in autarky but not under trade, the left-hand side of (2.22) is zero, no production, and the right-hand side is negative (production is unprofitable at free-trade prices).

Consider an economy that is endowed with a single good (or a small number of goods, no variation in produc tion possible). With trade, it is feasible for consumers to choose not to trade and continue their autarky consumption. If they choose to trade some of their endowment for new goods, this must be welfare superior since they are not choosing the alternative, feasible option of autarky.

Opening up to trade offers an opportunity to trade at international prices rather than domestic prices. This opportunity in itself offers a gain from exchange, as consumers can buy cheap er imported goods and producers can export goods at higher foreign prices. Further, there is a gain from specialization as the new prices established in free trade encourage industries to reallocate production from goods that the closed economy was producing at relatively high cost to goods that it was producing at relatively low cost. Thus, the basic allocative, or static, gains from trade arise from shifting the mix of outputs toward goods of comparative advantage (holding fixed the economy\u2122s"

While this proposition is straightforward to dem onstrate in theory it is far mo re difficult to marshal real-world data to support it. The reason is deceptively simp le: the ga ins-from-trade theorem is, in essence, a comparison of a consumption bundle cho sen at free trade with a consumption bundle chosen at autarky. The latter is virtually never observabl e since so few countries have existed in a state of autarky during a period in which consumption data would have been recorded.

There is one case from economic history that has b een studied closely by Daniel Bernhofen and John Brown (2005) in order to calculate the static gains from opening to trade. Japan in the 1850s remained an essentially closed economy after two cen turies of feudal rule by the Tokugawa Shogunate. Those rulers had limited trade to one Dutch ship pe r year and a few Chinese junks, with all goods traded by agents of the shogun\u2122 s treasury.

However, an American naval squadron appeared in Tokyo harbor in 1853 to prompt the Japanese government to consider trading with the Western powers. In 1858 Japan signed a treaty that ended the autarky system in July 1859. These foreign powers demanded rapid elimination of quotas and tariffs.

Second, the free-trade period arrived so qui ckly that new consumption and output data existed prior to much importation of foreign technology. Th ird, there was a dramatic change in relative goods prices due to the elimination of tariffs. A fourth convenient element is that Japanese history offers data on production of many tradable goods in both periods. To estimate the gains that Japan experienced in this rapid transformation the authors use the expenditure function introduced in Chapter 3. Here we define it in terms of consumption bundles rather than general utility. Thus, the expenditure function e(p,D) is the minimum expenditure the economy must make at price vector p to purchase the consumption bundle D (demand).

In autarky Japan\u2122s domestic prices for cloth, yarn , iron and foodstuffs \u0152 its primary imports after liberalization \u0152 were generally more than double or triple world prices, which were cheaper due to significant technological improvements abroad. Most importantly, these prices were quite high in relation to those of Japan\u2122s primary export commodities, which we re silk and tea. For example, the price of iron bars relative to tea was around nine times the corr esponding ratio in London in the 1850s (Huber, 1971).

The calculations do not account for further potential impacts of access to superior global technologies. Indeed, in an ear lier study, Huber (1971) speculated that the gains were as much as 65 percent of GDP, including the effects of technological change after trade liberalization.

We noted how this can occur if households have diffe rent tastes or different endowments of goods and/or factors. This will be very important later on in understanding the politics of trade policy, and why some groups will oppose liberalization or lobby in favor of protection from foreign competition despite the fact that free trade maximizes overall national income and welfare.

Chapters 7-10 examine alternative sources of differences between countries that can give rise to trade. Chapters 11 and 12 focus on scale economies and imperfect competition, which can give rise to trade even between identical economies. Part II of the book is thus c oncerned with the determinants of the direction of trade : what determines the pattern of imports a nd exports by particular countries. In fact, the trade of any country is a comp lex outcome of many causes all operating at the same time. There is, in general, no single cause of trade, but in order to understand the overall picture, we need to study how each possible cause of trade operates.

We are thus assuming that all countries can be represented by the situation of Figure 6. 1. Figure 6.1 What assumptions are sufficient to ensure that the demand and supply situations in all countries are identical? On the demand side, it is sufficient to assume that identical and homogeneous tastes exist throughout the world. On the production side we found that three things determine the position and shape of the production possibility curve - technology, returns to scale, and factor endowments.

These assumptions will give the same aggregat e demand and supply relationships in all countries, but there is one further restriction that we must impose. We are seeking conditions such that commodity price ratios will be the same in all c ountries, and this will only be the case if commodity prices are determined by aggregate demand and supply. We must, in other words, ensure that equilibrium prices are determined by the tangency between th e highest community indifference curve and the production possibility curve as shown in Figure 6.1, and to ensure this we assume there are no distortions, in the model. Distortions include taxes, subsidies, and imperfect competition. We can thus write down a set of five conditions that are jointly suffici ent to guarantee the no-trade situation.

The one-factor model can be thought of as a special case of condition 2 of the previous chapter: w ith one factor, the issue of differences in relative endowments does not arise. 1 Constant returns to scale are assumed. In terms of the production functions of Chapter 2, constant returns and one factor together imply that the produc tion possibility frontier will be linear. As we will see later, this assumption significantly simplifies the anal ysis. We also impose the remaining conditions of Chapter 6: there are no distortions such as imperfect competition or taxes, and tastes are identical and homogeneous (in fact, the last assumption is not needed for any of the principal results).

One principal determinant of this division is the economic size of countries - measured either in terms of their factor endowments or their productivity levels. In other words, a country is \"b igger\" economically to the extent that its production frontier is further from the origin. Let us theref ore conduct a thought experiment with our two countries [PAGE 99] 5 in which we make country f bigger by shifting its production fron tier in a parallel fashion further out from the origin. This can be accomplished either by increasing f\u2122 s endowment of labor or by improving its technology: increasing 1 and 2 in the same proportion.

These are extremely strong claims that we can reject simply by observing the world around us. There are many factors of production, including capital, land, and labor of varying skill levels.

Furthermore, we can easily reject a basic prediction of the model, that countries comp letely speci alize in particular products or industries. Extreme specialization may be relevant for countries with dom inant natural resources, such as Saudi Arabia and its heavy reliance on oil exports. However, this outcome is more related to resource endowments than to technolgical differences. In truth, the Ricardian model is a pronounced abstraction from reality designed to make important points about comparative advantage and the gains from trade rather than to serve as a basis for explaining real-world trade.

Before describing one study of this hypothesis let us take a brief look at some recent data.

T hus, they specified and estimated the following econometric equation: (7.15) The variable X ijk refers to exports of good i from country j to country k , while M ijk refers to imports of the same good coming into country j from country k .

If the Ricardian model is correct this coefficient should be significantly positive for that would imply that the country with more productive labor in a good has a higher ratio of exports to its trading partner than impor ts from its partner.

Among these are factor endowments, transport costs, and tr ade barriers. Thus, the authors assumed that such omitted variables are captured in the error term and need not be considered further, a claim that we discuss below. Second, astute readers may wonder why the independent variable is the ratio of absolute labor coefficients rather than the ratio, in each country, of productivity in a good relative to average manufacturing productivity. The latter is what the Ricardian model would suggest in the presence of multiple goods. In fact, this is not a problem because regression techniques actually estimate the impacts of deviations of particular observations from sample averages.

In that regard, the regressions may suffer from an omitted variables bias , which arises from the endogeneity of labor-value added coefficients. To try to control for this problem Golub and Hsieh simply lagged the right -hand side variable by one year to make it pre- determined. In general this is not a su fficient remedy for the endogeneity problem. Finally, the equations are estimated using data for 21 manufacturing industries.

This is an intriguing result and supports studying the Ricardian model for its practical relevance in addition to its theoretical el egance.

First, as noted, this simp le regression of trade on one variable \u0152 relative labor productivities \u0152 fails to control for other key determinants of international excha nge. It is easy to see from the low R 2 terms that this specification does not explain much of the variation in relative net exports. 7 Second, and more importantly , if those determinants, such as trade barriers, economic infr astructure, imperfect competition and capital and land endowments, are correlated with labor productivity th e coefficients may be biased to an unknown degree.

Third, the fact that data are missing for a number of countries and years, making the panel unbalanced, raises concerns about the stability and robustness of these estimates, though this problem is unlikely to imply that the true coefficients are negative. The net result of all these shortcomings is that while the authors have succeeded in demonstrating that there is a positive correlation between relative labor productivity and net exports, they have not established a causal relationship.

Thus, the econometric results may be picking up these kinds of factors and cannot be considered a true test of the Ricardian theory in the sense of accepting it and rejecting others. We conclude that labor productivity is certainly correlated with sectoral export performance but at best offers only a partial explanation for actual trade flows. 7.7Summary This chapter is the first of several chapte r which offer explanations as to the underlying differences between economies that can lead to diffe rences in autarky prices ratios and hence lead to trade.

The princi pal results of the chapter are as follows. The slope of a country's production frontier reflects its relative abilities to produce X 1 and X 2 . If these relative abilities differ between two countries, a pattern of comparative advantage exists. The existence of comparative advantage and potential gains from trade is quite comp atible with a situation in which one country has an absolute advantage in producing both goods.

The distribution of gains from trade between the two countries depends on several factors, but one important factor is the difference in absolute \"economic\" size between them, by which we mean the distance of a country's production frontier from the origin. A country is better off to the extent it trades further away from its own autarky price ratio and clo ser to the other country's autarky price ratio. We showed that when a country becomes bigger or more productive, its terms of trade tend to deteriorate (the equilibrium world price ratio moves closer to that c ountry's autarky price ratio).

In terms of the no-trade model of Chapter 6, we are now going to re-establish the assumption that countries have identical technologies, but relax the assumption that they have identical relative factor e ndowments. Obviously, this will require that we add a second factor of production. All of the other assumptions of the no-trade model remain in place. The development of this theory is generally associated with two Swedish economists, Heckscher and Ohlin.

We will focus on the two-good, two-factor case here and comment on more general models at the end of the next chapter. The two-factor Heckscher-Ohlin model is consid erably richer than the Ricardian model and allows for more realistic predictions. First, b ecause the production frontier is \ufb01bowed out\ufb02 as discussed in Chapter 2, countries will have much less of a tendency to specialize.

(1) If countries have identical constant-returns [PAGE 114] 5 technologies, then their cost functions for goods are the same, and the same two equations in (8.3) apply to both countries.

First of all, it emphasizes that, at least for a fairly small country that has little influence over world prices, large changes in the country \u2122s factor endowment may be absorbed by changing the composition of output with very little effect on factor prices. This is very different from the way that labor economists conceptualize the economy using the partial-equilibrium tools of suppl y and demand. The general-equilibrium Rybczynski theorem says that at constant world prices, the labor (or capital) demand curve is flat and big changes in [PAGE 117] 8 supply may have little effect on the wage (or return to capital).

Data on International Factor Intensities and Factor Endowments We begin by looking at straightforward measur es in 2000 and 2005 of factor use by industry and factor supplies by country. In Table 8.1 we show U.S. data for 17 manufacturing industries, ranked by capital expenditures (investment) per production worker in 2005. Production labor refers to workers who are engaged in essentially blue-collar activities, su ch as working on an assembly line. Non-production labor refers to employees who work in essentially wh ite-collar activities, such as clerical work and management.

While this is a crude breakdown, many economists think of production workers as less skilled on average and non-production workers as more skilled on average. It is worth noting that the number of production laborers declined in nearly all industries between 2000 and 2005, reflecting the rapid decline in manufacturing jobs in the United Stat es. At the same time, value added generally rose or fell slightly, indicating that remaining workers became more productive. Table 8.1 Looking at the 2005 figures it is clear that there are very large differences in capital expenditures per production worker, ranging from a low of $2,882 in apparel to almost $170,000 in petroleum and coal products. Investment depends clearly on the state of demand and the oil refining sector spent heavily in 2005 because of high oil prices.

The final column provides a rough verbal translation of these data into statements about whether the industry is capital-intensive, skill- intensive, or labor-intensive. In Table 8.2 we offer data on three types of factor endowments for a selection of countries. The first is a measure of capital stock divided by the la bor force. To compute a capital stock requires adding up aggregate investment expenditures in each econom y over a period of years and depreciating capital as it ages and we use a standard procedure for this pur pose.

From such simple measures it appears likely that factor intensities and endowments interact to provide an important explanation for international trade. We now consider what various important empirical studies have concluded about this fundamental question. The HO Theory in Multiple Dimensions Before getting to the empirical analysis, we need to undertake some additional theory. In particular, it is obvious that there are mo re than two goods, two factors and two countries in the world. What can we say about the HO model when there are mu ltiple dimensions? The basic model assumes two factors and countries, so ratios between usages of factors by industry and endowments of factors by country are sufficient to define factor intensities and factor abundances, respectively.

The prior production of these latte r inputs also required capital and labor in addition to other intermediate inputs, which, in turn requi red capital and labor and so on. Leontief developed a method for assembling these various inputs into an input-output table, which could then be used to compute the total labor and capital embodied in production of any bundle of goods. In terms of our theory the A matrix would account for both the direct inputs of capital and labor in making a car and the indirect capital and labor used in intermediate inputs. An obvious application of input-output analysis was to discover how mu ch capital and labor were required to produce US exports in comparison with US imports. Note"

While it is sensible to use an Ameri can input-output table to compute the factor contents of US exports, a computation of the factor contents of US imports would requi re detailed and consistent data on production techniques in all foreign trading pa rtners. This was infeasible for Leontief, so he calculated the capital and labor required to produce US goods that are similar to (or compete with) American imports. This procedure is valid theoreti cally under either of two conditions. First, if the factor-endowments model were true and internationa l factor prices were equalized, each country would share the same techniques of production and using the US table would not bias the import computations.

Second, if production functions exhi bited fixed coefficients, or a c onstant ratio of capital to labor regardless of the factor-price ratio, use of the US techniques would similarly capture foreign production methods adequately. In fact, the latter justification was taken by Leontief. Thus, Leontief calculated the capital and labor re quirements in the production of a representative bundle of $1 million worth of both exports and import- competing goods in 1947. Unquestionably in that year the United States was the most capital-abundant nation in the world since Japan and Western Europe had been decimated by World War II.. Thus, the United States surely was capital-abundant and labor- scarce relative to the rest of the world, suggesting that exports should be capital-intensive and imports labor-intensive.

In particular, his belief was that, becau se of superior education and training in conjunction with better management techniques, American labor was perhaps three times more productive than foreign labor. Thus, in effective labor units the Un ited States was really labor-abundant. While this view anticipated later thinking about labor skills (see belo w) it was ad hoc and unconvincing. The three-to-one ratio suggested by Leontief was not predicated on a careful evaluation of labor efficiency throughout the world, but was simply the ratio required to get the \"expected\" result.

Because the United States may have been an unusual country, si milar computations have been made for other countries with all manner of endowments, incomes, a nd market structures. In some cases the results of these studies were consistent with expectations under the endowment model. For example, Peter Heller (1976) demonstrated that Japan's international trade in the 1960s followed an interesting dual structure. Japan's exports to less-developed nations were capita l-intensive and its imports were labor-intensive. However, Japan's exports to more-developed nations were relatively labor-intensive in comp arison with imports.

The HO model relies on the specification of a long-run equilibrium without market distortions. It can hardly be argued that the econom ies of Europe and Japan were in an equilibrium in 1947, rather they were beginning a process of ra pid dynamic adjustment in production and factor supplies. Robert Baldwin (1971) recalculated Leon tief's ratios for the United States using the 1958 input- output table and 1962 international trade data, with the result that the paradox was still strongly in evidence. However, the analysis by Robert St ern and Keith Maskus (1981) showed that by 1972 American exports had become capital-intensive rela tive to imports.

For example, it is possible that the international structure of trade barriers could partially explain Leontief's result. Our analysis of the endowment model showed that free trade would lower the real incomes of each country's scarce factor, providing an incentive for that factor to lobby for import protection. Thus, the United States might be expect ed to have high trade barriers to labor-intensive imports and some foreign countries might erect rest rictions on capital-intensive imports.

The mo st substantive practical objection to Leontief' s procedure is simply that it is inadequate to suppose that there are only two primary factors of production, capital and labor, in the world. Various forms of land and natural resources also serve as sour ces of comparative advantage. Indeed, these may be the most relevant factors for the Heckscher-Ohlin model because they are internationally immobile. Further, physical capital and labor exist in different forms. We should not expect the average worker in higher-income countries to share identical productivity characteristics with the av erage worker in lower- income countries.

Recent Studies of Factor Endowments and Trade A full re-examination of Leontief\u2122s procedure was launched by Edward Leamer (1980), who worked out much of the theory above and the defin ition of factor abundance in equation (8.26). He noted that with more than three factors of production, or in the presence of unbalanced trade, a simple comparison of capital-labor ratios in exports versus imports was incorrect in revealing abundance.

In fact, the United States was a net exporter of both capital and labor services in 1947, largely because that country ran a significant trade surplus. As Leamer noted, condition (8.26) is equivalent to having the ratio of net exports of factor 1 to net exports of factor 2 exceed the ratio of those fact or contents in national c onsumption. Thus, he used Leontief\u2122s data to calculate the cap ital and labor contents of net expor ts (exports minus imports) in total, rather than for $1 million of each. He found that th ere were net capital exports of $23.4 billion and net labor exports of 2 million person-y ears in 1947. Ta king the ratio, Leamer calculated a capital-labor ratio in net exports of $11,783 per person-year.

Unfortunately, complex matters are rarely that simp le to resolve. Look again at condition (8.33), [PAGE 125] 16 which states that for a country to be revealed abundant in a factor its share in the global endowment mu st exceed its share in world GDP. Equivalently, labor could be an abundant factor only if American consumption per worker was less than global consum ption per worker. As Richard Brecher and Ehsan Choudhri (1982) pointed out, in 1947 this condition clear ly did not hold, for expenditure per worker in western Europe was approximately 50 percent of that in the United States.

In contrast, factors in rich countries are used quite productively and generate hi gh levels of output. We therefore have one hint at how to think about relaxing HOV: underlying technologies in different country groups are not the same. Let us return to testing the theorem. We coul d start with a weak version of testing condition (8.32), called the sign test : the sign pattern of the actual factor c ontent of net exports should be the same as the sign pattern of excess factor endowments.

Those authors used the 1967 U.S. input-output table to measure factor inputs (the A matrix in our theory), arguing that they should be common across all countries. They also developed measures of 12 types of factor endowments in 1966 and international trade for 27 countries in 1967 in order to calculate the factor contents of net exports and [PAGE 126] 17 excess endowments for many nations. They then com puted the signs of each factor content and excess endowment. Under HOV, these signs should match comp letely.

A further puzzle about these data was noticed by Trefler (1995). In nearly all countries and factors, the factor contents calculated on the left-ha nd side of condition (8.32) were near zero, imply ing that actual trade in factor services is much less than its factor-endowments prediction.

However, to make the problem tractable, a second specification the authors considered was that each country\u2122s input-output matrix differed from the U.S. matrix by a Hicks- neutral factor.

For this purpose they estimated a so-called gravity model of bilateral trade flows. v This model assumes identical and homogeneous preferences so that the demand for imports in country i for a product made in country j is equal to importers\u2122 share in world income times th e exporter\u2122s production of the good. However, this demand is reduced by trade restrictions between the countries, including the geographical distance between them. In their estimation they included ju st distance and assumed other influences were captured by a statistical error term. From the first-stage es timation they computed the predicted levels of both domestic consumption and bilateral trade flows in each good.

This specification is a considerable departure from the HOV tradition because it [PAGE 128] 19 uses the factor contents of predicted commodity flow s to measure a country\u2122s use of world factors through consumption and imports rather than direct world factor endowments. Note that by employing data constructed in this way the resulting regr ession fit is almo st certain to improve. It remains to see how well these hypotheses fit the da ta.

Table 8.4 It can be seen immediately that the basic HOV equation, using the U.S. technology matrix for all countries, utterly fails to comport with the data. The slope coefficient is essentially zero and insignificant, the equation explains only one percent of variation in the factor contents of net trade, and the sign test is accurate in only 32 percent of the cases. .The simp le Hicks-neutral correction in the second data column does not fare much better and the sign test still reveals a coin flip.

On this analysis, then, it seems that global data support a depiction of world trad e in which countries have broadly Hicks-neutral production functions but have sufficiently different e ndowments that they produce in different cones under unequal factor prices. Finally, demand patterns and di stance do affect the factor contents of trade. It seems that Davis and Weinstein indeed provided an \ufb01account of global factor trade\ufb02, as they called it.

But it raises a fundamental question: if we must introduce different technologies, variable factor prices, non-traded goods, and trade restrictions into the model, what is left of the HOV theorem? We offer two answers. First, it is obvious from simp le observation of the world that factor prices really are not equalized by trade in goods, even if there is a te ndency in that direction in the long run. Land prices remain high in Japan and Western Europe, skilled la bor commands high wages in the United States, and low-skilled labor remains relatively inexpensive in China and Vietnam. These prices reflect differing productivities and it is not surprising that a simple specification of technology would not capture them. vi The HOV theorem is a theoretical abstraction that expl ains important general-e quilibrium concepts and its assumptions cannot be expected to hold in practice. S till, it appears that the extension of the model to a world in which factor prices are not equalized, and capital-abundant (labor-abundant) countries use more capital-intensive (labor-intensive) techniques, fits actual data rather"

Thus, we consider this evidence to be largely consistent with unde rly ing factor-proportions theory . A second answer, however, is that distance, pr eferences, and other variables outside the HOV context seem to matter in driving factor trade also. A ccordingly, trade theorists have developed alternative theories of product differentiation and firm-level pr oductivity that now stand alongside Heckscher-Ohlin as basic explanations for trade. We consider th ese theories in detail in later chapters. 8.8Summary This chapter has considered a model in which th e only important difference between countries is in relative factor endowments. We assume that economi es are alike in all other respects, including having equal access to constant-returns-to-scale technologies, sharing homogeneous preferences, and exhibiting no market or policy distortions.

With this appro ach we established several important propositions about economic structure and trade patterns. [PAGE 129] 20 A country will export the commodity that uses the a bundant factor more intensively, which is the prediction of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem. Thus, comp arative advantage is determined by the structure of factor endowments (or autarky factor prices) in conj unction with relative factor intensities of commodities. A powerful insight about the effects of trade co mes from the factor-price-equalization theorem, in which free trade in goods actually equalizes the rela tive and absolute prices of homogeneous factors internationally. The essential reason for this result is th at trade in goods can substitute for trade in factors. The assumptions under which this theorem holds are severely restrictive and there are numerous reasons why we do not observe such equalization in practice.

The assumptions under which this theorem holds are severely restrictive and there are numerous reasons why we do not observe such equalization in practice. But there are important tendencies in that direction to the extent that international trade is th e result of variations in factor endowments. The Stolper-Samuelson theorem, which relates ch anges in commodity prices to changes in real factor prices, provides a fundamental prediction about the effects of trade (or impediments to trade) on the distribution of real incomes between (for exampl e) capital and labor. Because free trade causes exports and imports to rise, it follows that the relatively abunda nt factor gains real income in each country and the scarce factor loses real income. The gains-from-trade th eorem is relevant here, in that the economy overall enjoys a welfare rise in moving from autarky to free trade. However, the theorem will predict political conflicts within a country over trade liberalizati on versus protection in the absence of an explicit mechanism to redistribute gains.

This theorem is important for understa nding the effects of factor growth on the evolution of comparative advantage. The theorem is also im portant for understanding that large changes in factor supplies, especially in a small country with little infl uence over world prices, can be absorbed by changes in the composition of output with possibly very small changes in factor prices.

An alternative is to refer to all such mode ls as factor-proportions models. In other cases, the term Heckscher-Ohlin model is used in a much more rest ricted sense to refer to the two-good, two-factor, two- country case of the previous chapter.

The Jones\u2122 formulation retains two goods, but has three factors, making it seemingly more comp licated. Two of the factors are \ufb01specific\ufb02 factors, each having a use in only one industry and having no use in the other. The third factor is mobile and can costlessly move between the two sectors as both factors do in the Heckscher-Ohlin model. The fact th at only one factor is mobile here makes the model simpler than the HO formulation. As we will see, however, there are offsetting complications. In particular, while it is obvious that each final good is intensive in its specific factor, there is ambiguity about the mobile factor and what happens to outputs if the supply of this factor is increased.

There are several reasons why the specific-factor s\u2122 formulation is appealing, and perhaps these will become clearer as we proceed. First, the fact or-price equalization theorem does not hold and, oddly, trade economist are probably mo re comfortable with this theorem not holding: it just does not strike us as empirically very plausible. Second and more importa nt, the specific factors\u2122 formulation generates results that seem much more plausible from a political-economy point of view. In the Heckscher-Ohlin model, a group of factor owners such as capital or labor are always bound together regardless of what industry they work in. Capital owners should lobby for the capital- intensive industry even if their capital is in the labor-intensive industry. The specific-factors\u2122 mode l instead implies factors are allied with the industry they work in (though again with ambiguity with respect to the mobile factor)."

Third, the specific-factors\u2122 model seems much more plausible for the short and interm ediate run, in that it is costly or impossible to move factors between industries over a period of even a few years. Capital, for example, takes on industry-specific forms once installed, and it is not easy to transform shoe-making equipment into agricultural machinery. This is done over the long r un by allowing one type to depreciate and channeling all new investment into the other type.

Similarly, and beginning again w ith identical countries, give one country more of one of the specific factors, say K 1 , and the VMP 1 curve shifts up. This will increase the wage rate and reduce the price of the specific factor K 1 .

In particular it depends on the slopes of the two VMP curves in Figure 9.4. Note for example, that if VMP 1 is flat in Figure 9.4 (horizontal), then all of the added labor must go to the X 1 sector.

It is typically also defined fo r holding the prices of other factors constant, but in our case we define it for holding the quantity of the other factor, the sector-specific factor, constant.

These predictions are obviously important for policymakers trying to understand how domestic citizens would react to changes in trade policy, such as tariff liberalization or the negotiation of free trade areas.

Most significantly, it provided for the first time Presidential authority to negotiate liberalization of non-tariff barriers, such as impor t quotas and discriminatory government procurement laws, with other countries under the so-called \ufb01fast-track authority\ufb02. 1 This authority, under which a U.S. President could present a negotiated trade agreem ent to Congress, which then had to approve or disapprove it within a certain time period and without m odification, had already existed for tariff cuts. By extending it to non-tariff barriers the prospect of si gnificantly greater multilateral trade liberalization became apparent. The Act also provided the foundation for American participation in the ensuing Tokyo Round (1974-79) of trade negotiations at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the precursor to the World Trade Organization.

In Table 9.1 we show Magee\u2122s industry list a nd the classifications of labor and management interests revealed through testimony. Again, if th e SS theorem actually described policy preferences, we would expect all capital to support one position and all labor to support th e other, independent of industry affiliation. Thus, the diagonal cells should be empty , while one of the off-diagonal cells should contain all entries and the other one should be empty. It is obvious from the table that this prediction was decisively rejected by Magee\u2122 s categorization.

Table 9.1 From these results it seemed that rather than cons idering themselves to be mobile factors in a context in which free trade would redistribute income between them, capital and labor view themselves as specific to their particular industries. In this environment both factors preferred policies that they envisioned sustaining higher prices of the goods they produce. In short, fixed-factor models seemed [PAGE 145] 7 better at explaining lobbying for or against tariffs and quotas. This finding has been highly influential among trade economists. It suggests that in lobbying fo r trade policy, factor owners take a short-run view and that industries are natural opponents of each other ra ther than capital and labor in the larger sense. In short, the specific-factors model was heavily supported over the SS model. While provocative, Magee\u2122s study raised more qu estions than it answered.

An obvious question is why should these factors take a short-run approach to trade policy. Either factor owners really do care only about near-term impacts of policy changes as the specific-factors model would suggest, or they are irrationally myopic about the longer-term effects. In fact, this test could not readily sort out that question because in that era U.S. trade legislation came up for revision approximately every four years. Thus, rather than representing their interests on legislati on that would permanently alter policy, management and labor may have truly seen the 1974 Trade Reform Act as temporary, biasing the results against SS and toward the specific-factors approach. There are also methodological problems with Magee\u2122s study. Among many objections, two stand out. First, there are many other elements that affect citizens\u2122 views of trade policy that were not accounted for in this analysis.

Second, by using the testimony of industry associations and labor unions regarding a large piece of discrete legislation, Magee only indirectly measured preferences for protection or free trade. 2 It would be better to consider the opinions registered by individuals in surveys and correlated those views with basic economic characteristics. Among the many studies that have extended Magee\u2122s approach to account for these problems we discuss two. Edward Balistreri (1997) adopted the HOV model of mu ltiple goods and factors (described in the prior chapter of this text) to see if there was a correlation between individual Canadian citizens attitudes toward the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreem ent (CAFTA), which was under negotiation in the late 1980s, and their occupational employment. 3 He argued that occupa tions could be considered \ufb01factors\ufb02 in that they are types of labor differentia ted"

Further, he assumed reasonably that CAFTA was a permanent cha nge in trade policy, because, once enacted, neither country could change its terms or give up membersh ip except at very high cost. Balistreri claimed informally that abundant factors were likely to see their incomes rise, and scarce factors were likely to suffer declines in their incomes, if CAFTA were to be enacted. Thus, Balistreri\u2122s study was focused on whether individuals favored NAFTA based on their anticipated long-run income changes.

To measure i ndividual attitudes toward passage of CAFTA, he used an opinion survey of 2,470 people performed by York University in 1988. This survey asked Canadian respondents whether they favored or opposed the ag reement, while also asking about a variety of individual characteristics. One characteristic was occupation of employment, with occupations then assigned to the 21 categories in the basic sample. Armed with these data, Balistreri estimated a l ogit model to explain preferences toward CAFTA.

Rather than presenting the precise quantitative resu lts we simply discuss them here in qualitative terms.

This finding is largely in accord with an ex tended view of the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, though there is no precise theory proving that HOV-revealed factor abundance yields those factors whose real incomes will actually rise in general equilibri um. As a matter of correlation, however, it makes sense. Thus, Balistreri unearthed convincing eviden ce that individuals make decisions about trade policies that are consistent with the relative supplies of their occupations. The primary difficulty with the analysis, however, is that occupations may not really be an appropriate measure of long-run factors, since people may change their type of employment over their careers.

A second study that helped sort out the last probl em was by Scheve and Slaughter (2001). In this analysis the authors consider U.S. workers either to be skilled or unskilled. There is ample evidence that the United States is relatively skill abundant. Thus, th e long-run impact of trade liberalization should be to raise the real incomes of skilled workers and re duce those of unskilled workers. Thus, higher-skilled individuals should favor free trade and lower-skille d workers should favor protection. However, if individuals take a short-term view they would consider their incomes to be tied closely to price changes in the products made in their industry of employment.

Put in simplest term s, a skilled worker in tho se states, such as Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, that have experienced declin ing output and employment due to import competition would have a complex choice. She might favor open trade based on its long-run boost to skilled incomes. However, she might oppose it based on her industry of employment (such as automobiles or steel) and the potential loss in home value.

We will have more to say about this in Chapter 22 on political economy models of trade policy. 9.4Summary There are many possible formulations for factor-proportions models in which differences in relative endowments across countries link with differen ces in factor intensities across industries. The Heckscher-Ohlin model of the previous chapter is one and the Jones\u2122 specific-factor model is another. The Jones\u2122 formulation is popular in a number of applications including political economy models of lobbying for example. The fact that factors are allie d within industries rather than across industries seems to have some intuitive appeal. The Jones\u2122 form uation also escapes from factor-price equalization which many find an improbable result from Heckscher-Ohlin.

It is not the case that the role of the mobile factor can be discerned from factor intensities (as measured by factor shares) alone, we must also know the elasticities of substitution across industries to predict this factor\u2122s impact on trade. Analogs to the Stolper-Samuelson and Rybczynski theorem are developed. Specific factors are the big gainers or losers from commodity price chang es, which may be cause by trade liberalization or its opposite, increased protectionsim, or by change in the rest of the world\u2122 s economy. The model suggests that specific factor owners such as physical capital or human capital that is industry specific (has little use outside their industry) or land and resources, will be particularly fierce lobbyists on trade policy.

Thus throughout the tax analysis, we will assume that either (A) we have a single country facing fixed world prices, or (B) there are two countries that are identical in all respects.

Each consumer re gards their bill or check as being unaffected by their own purchases. For example, if a consumer pays $1 in sales tax, the consumer gets a refund of only $1/N of that amount, where N is the number of consumers (consider the refund if there are 100 million consumers). Thus each consumer does indeed rega rd the tax as raising prices, even though the tax is return to all consumers collectively. Similar comments apply to subsidies. We will specify taxes and subsidies in an ad va lorem (percentage of value) form throughout the chapter rather than in specific form. t will denote a tax and s a subsidy.

First, governments usually raise revenues in order to provide public goods that are not or cannot be provided by markets. No account is taken of public goods in this an alysis.

Here, we look at distortions and externalities (which are themselves a class of distortions) to see how asymmetries in distortions across countries can generate trade and may or ma y not generate gains from trade for each of two countries. One class of distortions is represented here by si mple production taxes and subsidies. In such a situation, it is important to keep track of different sets of prices, in particular consumer, producer, and world prices. The principal result of this analysis is that production taxes or subsidies can generate trade between otherwise identical countries, but it is a welfare-reducing trade for the taxing/subsidizing country. This carries a very important lesson for po licy makers: exports should never be confused with welfare.

[PAGE 160] 8 The second class of distortions addressed here ar e positive production externalities or spillovers, arising due to some failure on the part of firms to be able to capture returns for benefits they confer on rival firms. Examples include the lack of prot ection for intellectual property and innovations, and increases in productivity arising from the finer \ufb01divisi on of labor\ufb02 in a larger market. These issues will arise again in this book. These positive production externalities imply aggreg ate increasing returns to scale, even though individual firms have constant returns technologies. As discussed back in Chapte r 2, this can imply that the production frontier is convex (the production set non-convex) or \ufb01bowed in\ufb02.

The situation is not simple however, and we touch briefly on issues like the existence of multiple equilibria, with the alternative equilibria having very different welfare implications for the trading partners. The next two chapters continue to look at similar, even identical economies, and analyze how imperfect comp etition and increasing returns to scale offer added sources of gains beyond those arising from comparative advantage linked to differences between countries.

Trade economists believe that scale economies offer an important explanation for the observation of large volumes of trade between similar economies that we observe in trade data.. In this chapter and in the next, we will analyze these idea in a more thorough fashion. In this chapter, we will focus on a case where there are two industries, one producing a good under conditions of perfect compe tition and constant returns to scale, and a second good produced under conditions of increasing returns to scale. This IRS good is assumed to be homogeneous, meaning the goods produced by different firms are identical from the consumers\u2122 point of view.

We will assume that the X firms have technologies in which there is an initial fixed cost of entering production and then a constant marginal co st of added output.

In mathematical terminology, average cost is a rectangular hyperbola, going to infinity as X goes to zero and approaching mc as X goes to infinity. Figure 11.1 The consequences of this type of technology for competitive conditions, sometimes referred to as market structure are rather profound. Specifically, this type of increasing-returns technology cannot support perfect competition as a market outcome. This is ty pically explained by a proof by contradiction. Suppose that there are many small firms such that each firm regards market price as exogenous.

Then each or any firm knows once it produces enough output, price will exceed average cost, so profits become positive. But the firm would not stop there, it maximizes profits at the constant price by producing an infinite output and so expands without bounds. But this cannot be an equilibrium and contradicts the assumption that firms are small. Thus the technology shown in (11.1) and Figure 11.1 is inconsistent with perfect competition.

If you refer back to equation (11.4) the markup relates to how mu ch the market price falls when the firm increases its sales. When the demand elasticity is high, there is only a small fall in price when the firm expands output, and so the markup is small.

The situation quickly becomes co mplicated because internal or firm-level economies of scale are not compatible with perfect competition and hence th e simple tools needed to analyze competitive models need to be extended. Increasing returns to scale a nd imperfect competition are inherently related to one another. This require introduci ng new methods and new tools to ta ke into consideration firms with market power and the strategic interaction between su ch firms. In doing so, we simplified our theoretical economies in other ways, in particular on the factor market side, assuming only a single factor as in the Ricardian model of trade.

Autarky equilibrium for a country is distorted, and we showed that this distortion looks a lot like a production tax as modeled in the previous chapter. Price exceeds ma rginal cost in market equilibrium, and too little is produced at too high a price to maximize social welfare. [PAGE 174] 11 We then open up two identical economies to trade and show that this generates a pro-comp etitive effect. In technical terms, firms perceive demand as more elastic and hence expand outputs in response to the opening of trade.

It is in fact a special case in which all goods carry the same weighting in producing utility , and in which the elasticity of substitution is restricted to values greater than one. The latter assumption means that indifference curves intersect (all) the axes and so positive utility can be derived from a subset of goods. Indeed, the whole point of this approach is that only a subset of goods gets produced in equilib rium and that the number of goods available is endogenous. The individual goods in (12.1) are said to be symmetric but imperfect substitutes.

Consider first Figure 12.1, where the production frontier is . It may be that in autarky, a country may wish have variety even though it is expens ive in terms of having to pay the fixed costs for both goods, and hence prefers the autarky outcome shown as X a = D a in Figure 12.1.

It is crucial to note in Figure 12.2 that trade does not result in increased output of any good that is produ ced initially. No firm moves down its average cost curve, and there is no increase in firm scale. Ne vertheless, it is indeed scale economies that are responsible for the welfare gains since scale economies limit the number of goods produced initially.

Of course, the two appro aches can be comb ined, but the analy sis becomes more difficult and is left to mo re advanced treatments (e.g., Melitz and Ottaviano (2008)) and indeed the ideal variety approach does involve variable markups and pro-comp etitive effects. The two main approaches to product diversity are considered. The \ufb01love of variety\ufb02 approach assume an endogenous set of symmetric but imperfec tly substitutable products. Consumers are rewarded by a more diverse consumption bundle through trade. The \ufb01ideal variety\ufb02 approach works rather differently.

Often in this approach, the consumer is assumed to buy just a single unit or nothing. As in the love-of-variety approach, di versity, in this case giving each consumer their ideal product, is costly in the presence of scale economies, so consumers accept compromise varieties in small autarky markets. The rewards to trade are that cons umers, on average, get products closer to their ideal varieties. While much of the literature has focused on fi nal goods, an important variation of these models considers the differentiated products to be inte rmediate goods used in producing homogeneous final goods. Allowing trade in intermediate goods offers final producers higher productivity by increasing the division of labor. This ideal is a cornerstone of what is referred to as endogenous growth theory (e.g., Romer 1987) and has also been applied to trade in components and in producer services.

The purpose of this chapter is to introdu ce costs of trade, which we can think of as shipping costs (it should also include time costs but this requi res an explicitly dynamic treatment).

So if mc is marginal cost, the cost of supplying the foreign market is (mc + t) . In a one-factor model such as a Ricardian model, this would be in units of labor for example.

This is just a reflection of the price differences inside the two countries: in each country , the export good is relatively cheap and the import [PAGE 194] 3 good is relatively expensive. Countries that produ ce relatively more food will consume relatively more food, even if preferences are identical. This is sometimes referred to as a \ufb01home-market effect\ufb02 or \ufb01home bias\ufb02 as we will discuss below. However, there is a subtlety if you are interested . Consumption specialization refers here to quantities, but home-market effect is often used to refer to value or expenditure shares in consumption (price times quantity divided by income).

In Chapter 8, we demonstrated that in autarky, each country has a relatively high price for its scarce factor. Under special circumstances, completely costless trade brings the price of each factor into equality across countries (the factor-price-equalization theorem). Cons istent with the notion that costly trade is between autarky and costless trade in competitive, constant-re turns models, the price of each factor will converge across countries but will not equalize in Figure 13.2.

We turn to some of these effects in this and the next few sections. In th e current section, we use the simple oligopoly model of Chapter 11: linear demand, constant marginal cost s, and firms produce identical, homogeneous products. We will assume that the two countries are absolutely identical in size, costs and preferences (to exploit symmetry in solving the model), that each country has a single firm in the X sector, and that there is no exit or entry of firms.

Interestingly, profits recover with further falls in trade costs wh en trade costs are low, near the right-hand boundary. This result can seem puzzling at first, even to trained economists who would guess that welfare should rise with any fall in trade costs.

Many industries may be characterized as being relatively open to entry and populated by firms with some increasing returns to scale. At the same time, consumers have a taste for variety and firms can reduce costs by having access to a wide variety of in termediate inputs.

If the effect of openness to trade is to expand output in the more productive firms while pushing the less production enterprises out of business there should be an overall increase in productivity. In this section we present evidence on each of these four hypotheses, which continue to be heavily studied at the forefront of international trad e analysis. The underlying literature is very large and we can only summarize some seminal articles here. Inte rested students may wish to read more widely.

More precisely, the markup of price over marginal costs should go down. Intuition and evidence are different things, however, so economists have considered this problem in a number of countries that went through significant import liberalization episodes. Before considering the results, however, a number of initial issues need to be addressed. 1 To begin, recall from Chapter 11 that for firm i selling in an oligopolistic home market its markup equation is (13.34) p mc s i i i = \u2212 1 1 () \u0002 Thus, a firm\u2122s markup increases as its market share gets bigger and decreases as demand elasticity falls. International trade may affect both of these parameters. [PAGE 206] 15 2 In Chapters 18 and 19, we will describe ava ilable data sets covering tariffs and non-tariff barriers.

(13.35) PCM pqcq pq pc p it itititit itit itit it = \u2212 = \u2212 This expression shows the PCM for a firm i in a year t. If we assume that average cost (c it ) is constant in the neighborhood of existing sales, so that it cap tures movements in marginal cost, the PCM is a monotonic transformation of the standard markup in (13.34). We can therefore use the middle part of this equation, which requires data on sales and input cost s, to proxy for the markup, keeping in mind this strong assumption.

Thus, the sta ndard approach to analyzing the impact of import competition on markups is to estimate the following equation: (13.36) PCMKSALESIMPX itititjj j it =+ ++ + \u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0004 012 Here, KSALES is the ratio of the capital stock to firm-level or industry-level sales, a measure of capital intensity.

A better approach is to try to incorporate a variable that directly captures cuts in tariff rates or elimination of quotas, since the hypothesis is about changes in exposure to competition. However, it is often difficult to find such data. 2 Among the control variables it is important to include some indication of how much market power exists, since it seems likely that industries and firms with more domestic market power are liable to experience sharper declines in markups.

After 1973, a radical reform was imposed and the average tariff rate fell to 12 percent by 1979, with much of the regulatory system removed.

The IMP variable is not significant in the first three countries, but there is a strongly negative effect of the interaction term in both Chile and Colombia.

Interestingly, the interaction term on SHARE and TAR is significantly positive, implying larger plants in industries with high tariff protection have higher PCMs. This is also consistent with the hypothesis that import competition forces domestic firms to reduce their markups. An interesting variation on this theme is found in the study by Hoekman, et al (2004). These authors argue that one would expect the size of a country to matter in terms of how much competition affects markups. There are really two types of po licy changes that expand competition for domestic firms with market power: reductions in domestic entry barri ers through changes in regulation, such as anti-trust enforcement and liberalization of credit markets, a nd the easing of foreign entry barriers through lowering trade restrictions, such as tariffs. 3 Hoekman, et al hypothesize that the ability of tariff cuts to reduce domestic markups should be larger in"

On th e other hand, relaxation of entry regulations should have a larger impact in bigger markets where competition among domestic firms would be mo re significant. They tested these ideas using data from a sample of 21 industries in 42 developed and developing countries over the period 1981 to 2000. They used an econometric method that permitted efficient estimation of markups in the first stage by correcting for endogeneity between markups and industry-level inputs (Olley and Pakes, 1996).

Both of these findings support the basic hypothesis. This study has not been replicated with firm-level data to our knowledge. Overall, while the results of the studies reviewed here are not definitive, they do suggest that trade liberalization, especially in developing econom ies, often reduces the margins between prices and costs, particularly at the level of individual pr oduction plants. While more work could be done, this evidence does tend to support the underlying theory.

Thus, international trade in this industry is largely driven by comparative advantage.

Mexico\u2122s higher index of 63 percent IIT suggests an inter esting phenomenon. Mexico tends to import large volumes of basic apparel products (unprocessed cotton, for example) from the United States, which it then assembles into finished apparel products for export back to the United States.

Table 13.3 shows the results of an interesting recent study of this questi on using U.S. tariffs and import data (Feenstra and Kee, 2007).

Note, however, that in principle the exponents on the national GDP terms are both equal to one, so those co efficients should not be much different from unity. Stated this way, the gravity equation is disarmingly simple. It simply states that bilateral trade between any two countries is determined by size a nd distance. The importer size matters because that determines its share of world consumption, while the exporter size matters because that determines its output volume, some of which can be exported.

Empirical Uses of Gravity There are hundreds of published articles in the litera ture that estimate some form of the gravity equation as an explanation for bilatera l international trade and investment flows, at both the aggregate and sectoral levels.

Both factors should expand the value of bilateral trade. Frankel, et. al. included the log of the distan ce between the largest cities in each of the two countries. They also added ADJ , which is a dummy variable that takes on the value of one where the countries share a common land border and zero otherwise.

This use of simple binary variables to capture impacts on trade other than those modeled by distance is common in the literature. Finally, EC, WH, and EA are dummy variables that are unity when the pair of countries both reside in the European Community, [PAGE 215] 24 8 For a review, see Overman, et al (2003).

Note that the elasticity of bilateral trade with respect to the product of country-pair GNP levels is 0.72, which clearly demonstrates that market sizes assert substantial impacts on trade. However, this coefficient is statis tically less than 1.0, which is inconsistent with the theoretical gravity model. Distance is negative and hi ghly significant, with an elasticity of 0.51. Thus, an increase of one percent in geographic distance between two countries that are not adjacent to one another reduces their mutual trade by 0.5 percent.

In this context, it is no surprise that countries w ithin the European Union trade much more among themselves than outside the area. Similarly, sharing a common language or colonial history tends to raise bilateral trade by 60 percent (exp(0.47) = 1.60).

The model is an ad hoc gravity specification; there are likely important omitted variables, including tariffs and other trade restrictions, and the use of aggregate trade data eliminates the possibility of considering whether the impacts of distance are larger on differentiated goods versus other kinds of goods. Still, these results strongly suggest that geography matters a great deal for international trade flows.

To understand their thinking, go back to the model with differentiated products and monopolis tic competition in Section 13.4. In particular, equation (13.25) demonstrated that a larger country mu st produce mo re differentiated varieties of good X than a smaller [PAGE 216] 25 country. In fact, it produces more differentiated products relative to its GDP than does the small country.

This specification was estimated for three types of goods as defined by James Rauch (1999). There are homogeneous goods, such as raw materials and primary goods, that are traded in organized international exchanges. Next are reference-priced goods that have prices quoted by industry sources (such as trade magazines) but are not tr aded on exchanges. Finally there are differentiated goods, which are neither traded on exchanges nor have posted prices.

However, Rose\u2122s grav ity models could not find a consistent and significant impact of WTO membership on trade.

Desp ite this larger workforce, exporters are more [PAGE 218] 27 productive, as shown by the 11-percent higher value added per worker and three-percent higher total factor productivity (TFP). Exporting firms also pay a higher average wage and have larger capital stocks per worker and skills per worker (measured by non- production employ ees divided by total employ ment). Thus, it is clear that exporting firms tend to be larger and mo re productive. At the same time, they differ in capital and skill intensity, suggesting that basic comparative advantage"

Thus, it is clear that exporting firms tend to be larger and mo re productive.

Similar results were found for Chilean firms by Alvarez and Lopez (2005). The final two rows point out another important distinction. Compared with non-exporters, exporting firms on average sell 27 percent more product lines (defined at the 5-digit Standard Industrial Classification of disaggregated industries). This mean s that exporters have a wider range of products to sell. Economists refer to this outcome as a more pronounced extensive margin in that exporters compete in part on the basis of expanding the number of product lines. At the same time they have a larger intensive margin on average because their sales per product ar e larger by 73 percent.

This fact strongly suggests that firms are heterogeneous and that the largest also account for the mo st international trade. One interesting question to pose at the outset is the direction of causality. Do more productive firms engage in exports or do firms become more productive because they export? Evidence from the United States strongly suggests that there is a selection effect : firms that are already more productive or larger tend to enter export markets. This suggests that there are sunk costs or fixed costs to enter foreign markets that only larger firms can absorb, as emphasized by Roberts and Tybout (1997) and Melitz (2003).

One exception is the study by Van Biesebroeck (2005), which finds evidence that exporting raises productivity among sub-Saharan African enterprises. This remains an active research area. The more fundamental question raised by the th eory of heterogeneous firms is whether more openness to trade, either by reductions in trade cost s or through tariff cuts, tends to reallocate production among firms. Specifically, the primary prediction is that as countries become more integrated the competition should, in each market, force the l east productive firms to exit and permit the mo st productive firms, the exporters, to expand. An altern ative possibility is that firms will close their most inefficient plants and reallocate pr oduction to more productive locations.

Pavcnik\u2122s study is an excellent example of the importance of careful econometrics. Her goal was to [PAGE 219] 28 analyze whether productivity in individual manufacturing plants that faced greater import competition increased productivity by more than that in other plants. For this purpose, one needs a measure of efficiency, which she defined as TFP (total factor productivity) in a Cobb-Douglas econometric specification: , (13.45) log()loglog() yxk ititkitit =+++ \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0004 0 \u0004 \u00b5 ititit =+ This equation states that gross output (y it ) of plant i at time t is produced by a vector of variable inputs (x it ) , including intermediates, raw materials, and labor, pl us the plant\u2122s capital input.

This is because the manager will choose inputs based on her knowledge of plant efficiency, so the input variables are correlated with the error term. The result would be inconsistent ordinary least squares estimates of the coefficients and potentially large errors in calculating TFP. There is a further problem: plant and firm managers will decide whether to exit production based in part on this private information a bout efficiency.

To deal with simultaneity, Pavcnik incorporat ed a dynamic, non-parametric approach pioneered by Olley and Pakes (1996). In any period, each plan t first makes a decision about whether to shut down operations, which is less likely for firms with larger capital stocks and also depends on expected market competition. In this theory, a plant will continue to produce and invest if its unobserved efficiency term exceeds a critical value depending on its existing capita l stock. The efficiency term can then be () it expressed as a function of capital stock and current inv estment. Then this function can be substituted into (13.45) to explain gross output as a function of va riable inputs, the capital stock, and a polynomial expansion in capital stock and investment terms.

There remains the plant-selection bias. Pavcnik dealt with this bias by estimating the implicit threshold level of productivity below which a plant would exit by regressing the decisions of plants to continue producing on lagged investment values. P ast investment should not affect current output but does influence future profitability, making it a good instrumental variable for exit decisions. After making these adjustments for simu ltaneity and selection bias, Pavcnik estimated a second- stage TFP equation, in which gross output less variable inputs is a function of current and lagged capital stock and the observed probability of plant survival , computed across all plants in the data.

Based on trade patterns of the four-digit ISIC industry in which it produced, each pl ant was characterized as either export-oriented, non- traded, or import-competing. One initial result is that plant survival is a dynamic process in Chile. Of the plants in existence in 1979, 35 percent had ceased production by 1986. Of these, 13 percent were in export-oriented sectors and 40 percent were in the im port-competing sector, suggesting that plant closures [PAGE 220] 29 were more common in import-competing sectors. In short, exit decisions are important in the wake of trade liberalization. Turning to the econometric work, Pavcnik\u2122 s estimated growth in productivity levels by plant could be compared by simple averages across all surviving plants and averages weighted by initial plant size.

However, unweighted productivity grew only in food ma nufacturing and textiles. This result supports the view that firms adjust to greater import competition and export opportunities by shifting resources from less productive to more productive plants. Over tim e, the more productive plants produced a growing share of output in nearly all industries. For manufacturing as a whole, TFP rose by 19 percent, which was comp rised of a 6.6 percent increase in within-plant efficiency and a 12.7 percent gain in productivity due to resource shifts among plants. Her final task was to regress TFP across plants and time on year dummies, trade orientation, interaction terms between year dummies and trade orient ation, and control variables.

This implied that surviving import-competing plants became more productiv e, with efficiency gains associated with trade liberalization ranging from 3.0 percent to 10.4 percent. Finally, plants in export-oriented sectors did not experience a significant rise in productivity after th e trade openness policies were adopted. As noted earlier, this likely reflects the fact that exporters were already mo re efficient and had little room for productivity growth. To summarize, Chilean manufacturing firms reacted to greater import competition through a combination of plants shutting down, reallocation of resources to more productive plants, and higher productivity per surviving facility.

Using detailed microeconomic data, they estimated the responses of plant productivity to reductions in industry-level import tariffs and measures of trans portation costs from 1982 to 1997. They calculated that the average four-digit SIC industry saw a decline in shipping costs of 0.19 percent points per year in that period, and that average tariffs fell by more than 25 percent in the majority of sectors. To summarize their result, the authors first re gressed adjusted measures of TFP for each industry on trade costs (a combination of tariffs and trans port charges) and found that a one-standard-deviation reduction in such barriers raised TFP growth by 0.19 percent per year, a significant outcome.

On the other hand, a one-standard devi ation fall in trade costs raised the probability that a non-exporting plant would enter foreign markets by 0. 6 percent but the impact was significantly higher for higher-productivity facilities. In short, their ma in finding was that in response to falling transport costs, some plants, primarily lower-productivity non- exporters, were mo re likely to exit while higher- productivity non-exporters were more likely to start e xporting. Each of these outcomes is consistent with a model of heterogeneous firm behavior. [PAGE 221] 30 13.9Summary Trade costs have long been somewhat neglected in both trade theory and empirical analysis.

In models with increasing returns and imperfect competition however, there are quite a number of situations in which trade costs do not leave country in between autarky and free trade. We first consider a simple oligopoly model of the type analyzed in Chapter 11 and allowed firms to price discriminate between markets. We showed that trade costs in this environment can lead to two-way trade even in identical goods, a form of intra-industry trade, and to the pricing of exports below that of domestic sales (dubbed \ufb01reciprocal dumping\ufb02 by Brander and Krugman (1983)).

Monopolistic-competition models generally assume that price discrimination is not possible (why, we don\u2122t know), yet several interesting features ha ve been identified. First, countries that differ only in size will have different patterns of specializati on in the presence of trade costs. The larger country will be relatively specialized in the differentiate d goods sector, being a net e xporter of differentiated goods to the small country and a net importer of the homogeneous competitive good. Thus intra and inter-industry trade will co-exist even though the count ries are identical except for size.

But firm heterogeneity is quite interesting in the presence of trade costs. In particular, a fall in trad e costs leads to the exit of the least productive domestic firms, and the expansion of the most productive domes tic firms into exporting as well. Falling trade costs now offer an additional source of gains from trade due to the rise in the average productivity of firms surviving in the market place.

Many models assume that consumers have identical and homogeneous utility functions, rega rdless of location. Then if commodity prices were equalized by trade, consumers everywhere would demand goods in the same proportions. All trade would then be due to various differences in production among countries. As students have by now realized, this emphasis generates a markedly diverse and sophisticated set of predictions about the supply-side determinants of comparative advantage, such as differences in factor endowments, policy-based market distortions, and imperfect competition associated with increasing returns to scale. There has been much less theoretical attention paid to demand-based determinants of trade. There has also been little empirical examination of the apparent presumption by trade economists that production differences are more important than cons umption differences for explaining trade patterns.

Fo r example, in 1991 59% of household consumption in Bangladesh was estimated to have been devoted to food. The corresponding shares of food in household budgets in other countries were: Indonesia 48%, Argentina 35%, Greece 30%, Japan 17%, and United States 10% (World Development Report, 1993). In contrast, budget shares allocated to medical care were: Bangladesh 2%, Indonesia 2%, Argentina 4% , Greece 6%, Japan 10%, and United States 14%. In part, these differences reflect variations in relative prices due to trade barriers and government policies. However, they clearly indicate that preferences are not homogeneous: as per-capita income rises, the relative share of income spend on food declines, and that on medical care rises.

Accordingly, one purpose of this chapter is to bri ng together some strands of literature in order to examine the possible ways in which international di fferences in consumption patterns can influence trade flows. Identical in production, different in tastes It is surely true that countries differ in their aggregate preferences over different sets of goods and services. Figure 14.1 makes the point in the simp lest possible way. Each of two countries have the same identical production frontier, but country h has a relative preference for good X 1 and country f has a relative preference for good X 2 .

Each country imports the good for which it has a relatively high preference in demand. International trade economists have long been a bit uncomfortable with trade generated in this [PAGE 235] 2 way, since arbitrary preference differences may be a cheap way to explain a great deal of trade. Clearly, people in hot, tropical climates are going to eat different food, dress differently, and build their house differently from consumers in colder climates. Consumption patterns can also reflect differences in culture and religion. But economists tend to look fo r systematic factors that cause trade rather than somewhat arbitrary differences in preferences are unexplained by any systematic underlying factors.

This is the notion that consumers have a systematic preference for home produced varieties of goods over fo reign ones. This may be due to some subtle underlying product differentiation (packaging, size, color, spice and other characteristics of food, etc.) in which domestic producers target their products fo r domestic tastes. But even with perfectly homogeneous goods, consumers might prefer beef in a beef-producing country and rice in a rice- producing country. This idea is shown in Figure 14.2 where country h has a comp arative advantage in X 1 and country f has a comparative advantage in X 2 , the two countries producing at points X h and X f respectively.

One problem with this argument is that it is hard to discriminate empirically between this taste- based home bias and that arising from trade costs. Refer back to Figure 13.2.

In Figure 14.2, in which the prices of goods are the same across countries, it is unamb iguous that country h spends a larger share of its income on good X 1 . But in Figure 13.2, the price of a good is high where its consumption quantity is low. If preferences are Cobb-Douglas, then we have seen several times that the shares spent on goods are constants: a ten percent higher price means ten pe rcent lower quantity, so the share spent on each good is constant and independent of prices.

Non-homogeneous demand [PAGE 236] 3 A final contribution of preferences and demand to explaining trade flows lies in the role for per- capita income. Trade theory has long used th e assumption of identical and homogeneous preferences between countries in order to focus on production as a determinant of trade, not because is a good assumption. In fact, probably every budget study ever done has shown very subs tantial deviations from homogeneity : some goods, such as food, have much la rger budget shares at lower incomes while others such as medical care and recreation have mu ch higher budget shares at higher incomes. Instead of countries differing in preferences, another pure case is that countries have identical preferences that a/re non-homogeneous.

Suppose that there is some minimum consumption required for good X 2 in order to survive or before any X 1 will be purchased. This amount is denoted by the point in Figure 14.3. Once the consumer can afford this am ount, consumption follows the path shown in Figure 14.3 with the slope of this income-consumption curv e constant (linear Engel\u2122s curve) but depending on relative prices. With these preferences, assumed to be identical across two countries, the share spent on good X 1 will rise with per capita income and the share spent on X 2 falls.

[PAGE 237] 4 14.2The Linder Hypothesis The analysis of the possible role of per-capita in come in determining trade leads naturally to a discussion of the ideas of Swedish economist Staffan Linder (1961). Linder argued that the principles governing trade in manufacturing goods are not the same as those governing trade in primary products. He was quite prepared to support the idea that tr ade in primary products is determined by factor endowments. However, he argued against the notion that differences in factor endowments are the major determinants of trade in manufactured products. He c hose, instead, to highlight the role of consumption demand, beginning his argument with an observation similar to the one we made in our chapter on increasing returns to scale: a large volume of trad e exists between the developed countries. These countries have very similar factor endowments and thus, according to the Heckscher-Ohlin theory, we might not expect a large volume of trade between them.

We mu st, therefore, look for a cause of trade other than factor endowments. Linder contended that a manufactured good is creat ed by an innovative entrepreneur in response to a perceived demand. A new manufactured good is, in other words, introduced only when an entrepreneur believes there is sufficient potential dema nd to warrant production. It is this perception of potential demand that triggers production rather than considerations of factor endowments. The second step in the argument is that entrepreneurs are most familiar with their home market. Barriers of distance, language, and culture indicate entrepreneurs are much less familiar with foreign markets and are unlikely to be able to perceive what sort of new products could be successfully introduced into foreign markets. The third step follows from the first two. Fo r a manufactured product to be produced in (and therefore potentially exported from) a country, there must exist significant home demand for the product. The range of manufactured goods produced in a country is, therefore, determined by domestic demand as much as by production considerations, such as factor endowments."

Suppose then that an entrepreneur perceives a home demand for a product and begins production. Where will he find export opportunities for additional sales? Linder argued that the best opportunities will be found in countries that have very similar demand patterns to the entrepreneur's home country. Thus, if an American invents a new communications device, such as a modem or telefax machine, and produces it for the home market, his best export opportunities will be found in Canada, Western Europe, and Japan. Similarly, entrepreneurs in Canada, Western Europe, and Japan will find that their best foreign markets will be in the United States and in each other's countries.

However, people in countries with much higher per-capita incomes may want more sophisticated devices, such as coffee makers with flashing lights, digital readout, and tim ers. Thus the volume of trade in manufactured goods will be highest among countries of similar per-capita in comes, such as the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Japan. Predictions about which specifi c products each country would export are difficult to make, because such exports would depend on the hist ory of entrepreneurial activity in each market. Overall, however, international patterns of inco me and demand determine the extent of trade in manufactured goods, rather than only factor endowments or technology.

Individual en trepreneurs enter a market with unique varieties of differentiated goods, which are sold to consumers in all countries. Thus, there can be a substantial volume of trade even between identical countries. Th e most popular vehicle for these models is the Dixit- Stiglitz utility function and large-group monopolistic comp etition. However, this extensive literature left out an important part of Linder\u2122s theory, the ro le of per capita income. The monopolistic-competition approach to trade assumes homogeneous preferen ces over both differentiated goods and between these goods and another sector, usually a co mpetitive, constant-returns sector.

Per-capita income and trade volumes As described in Table 14.1, it is clear that the income elasticity of demand varies across goods. This means that the shares of a country\u2122s national e xpenditure spent on particul ar goods vary with levels of per-capita income. For example, Hunter (1991) listed figures showing that countries with annual per- capita income less than $750 in 1973 spent 50 percent of income on food, five percent on house furnishings, and four percent on medical care. In contrast, countries with per-capita incomes between $3,800 and $5,200 spent 17 percent on food, nine pe rcent on house furnishings, and nine percent on medical care.

This idea is quite different from the standard trade-theory assumption that preferences are identical and homogeneous across countries at all leve ls of income. How does this difference seem to affect the volume of trade? Hunter\u2122s (1991) early study is an interesting attempt to sort out this question. To understand her approach consider Figure 14.9.

To reconcile this problem, Hunter used purch asing-power parity (PPP) exchange rates to compute implied relative prices of goods and services across na tions. Second, trade costs and trade barriers generate differences in relative prices across nations ev en at PPP exchange rates. Here Hunter makes the strong assumption that once consumption patterns are neutralized for per-capita income differences the resulting demands arise from Cobb-Douglas preferences. In that case consumption shares depend only on income levels, not on relative prices, permitting her to ignore the existence of relative price differences in the final stage.

If both of these statements are true we should see that trade among higher-income economies is disproportionately in goods with higher quality levels.

The standard procedure, follo wed by Schott, is simply to look at highly detailed product categories within which goods may reasonably be assumed to meet specific needs of consumers or input buyers, then argue that higher-priced vers ions should reflect higher quality. The United States International Trade Commission, for example, makes av ailable data on U.S. imports from, and exports to, all countries on product categories at the 10-digit le vel of disaggregation under various classifications. 1 The figures include both import and export values and e xport quantities.

Despite these problems, it is interesting to report Schott\u2122s primary findings. The author analyzed 10-digit product-line unit values over the period 1972- 1994 from over 130 U.S. trading partners. These countries were defined as low-wage (L), middle-wage (M), and high-wage (H) based on real per-capita GDP. Specific 10-digit products were categorized as coming from L, M, or H nations solely or from combinations of such countries where, for exampl e, a product arrived both from low-wage China and high-wage Canada. With this brea kdown, one striking conclusion is that there seems to be relatively little specialization across products. In 1972, around 30 percen t of U.S. imported products originated in all three types of countries (LMH goods). This share rose steadily to over 60 percent by 1994, strongly suggesting that countries of all income levels tend to produce the majority of goods even within"

This result seems sharply at odd with traditional trade theories in which countries tend to specialize across industries. Instead, it seem s that there is significant within-industry and even within-product specialization. Within-industry competition is consistent with models of monopolistic competition in horizontally differentiated goods. Ho wever, within-product competition that involves exporters at all levels of income suggests an additional important f act: there is considerable vertical differentiation in product quality. The next question is what explains this quality differentiation. Schott focused on supply-side determinants. Table 14.2 lists the basi c results, which demonstrate convincingly that unit values rise as exporters have higher per-capita GDP, higher capital-labor endowments, and higher skilled labor endowments. 2 All of these coefficients are positive and highly significant in regressions that also included product-year fixed effects.

Table 14.2 Schott went further and related unit values to underlying industry production techniques. Using cross-country data from the United Nations he constructed capital-labor ratios for 28 3-digit manufacturing industries and assigned the traded goods in the import categories to these industries. 3 Using data for 1990, he regressed the log of unit values (by product and exporting country) on the log of capital-labor intensities (by country) for each industr y, including product fixed effects.

In summary, Schott\u2122s analysis of detailed price da ta in U.S. imports suggests that there is not much cross-product specialization but there is cons iderable within-product specialization. Moreover, these prices rise with incomes, capital, and skill e ndowments of exporters and also with the capital intensity of production.

Rather, it seems that more productive firms specialize in higher-value and higher-quality goods. Thus, Schott\u2122s important paper raises a number of questions for further empirical work. What about demand for quality? This is an im portant question for a number of reasons. For example, perhaps Schott\u2122s finding that higher-incom e economies produce higher-quality goods really is a demand-side phenomenon.

We began by describing ways that demand can matter: tastes can simp ly be different across countries in some sort of random way, or perhaps consumers have systematic bias toward domestically produced goods, a type of home bias.

Oddly enough, the large literature on monopolistic competition addressed in Chapter 12 enthusiastically adopted the role of product differentiation, but abandoned Linder\u2122s crucial identif ication of the role of per-capita income. Later work (Markusen 1986) put this pa rt of Linder back into the monopolistic-competition model and showed that if differentiated goods are both capital (or skilled-labor) intensive and have high income elasticities of demand, then there will be a hi gher level of north-north trade and a lower level of north-south trade than is predicted by standard m odels with homogeneous preferences.

Anyone who has read history is aware of many examples of human migrations, such as those from Europe to North America in the nineteenth century. Tho se familiar with more contemporary business events are aware of the high degree of capital movements and foreign investment that have characterized the world economy since World War II. It is thus apparent that some factors of production are mobile. What are the effects of such factor movements on world trade and welfare? This question is of particular interest in countries which are the source of foreign investment, as well as countries which are the recipients of investment.

A direct foreign investment is defined as an investment in which the i nvestor acquires a substantial controlling interest in a foreign firm or establishes a subsidiary in the foreign country. Foreign direct investment (FDI) thus involves ownership and/or control of a business enterp rise abroad. Comp anies that engage in foreign direct investment are known as multinational enterprises or transnational corporations. FDI will be the subject of Chapter 16.

Of course, portfolio investment and labor migration occur for reasons other than differences in factor prices. These reasons might include escape from war or repression in the case of labor migration, or uncertainty over future economic conditions in th e case of capital mobility. With this caveat in mind, we restrict our discussion to factor movements motivated by factor price differences. Portfolio capital movements and labor migrati on have very similar effects on production and trade. Thus, we analyze the two together, generally referring arbitrarily to capital as the mobile factor.

This is credited to Mundell (1957), and indeed, the idea was so persuasive that little research followed on trade in factors for many years: there was just not very much interesting to say. The idea is that if trade in goods is based on differences across c ountries in factor endowments, then allowing factors to move will substitute for trade in goods. There are, in fact, two different senses in which trade in goods and factors can be substitutes, both perhaps implicit in the previous sentence but not always aligned in practice. First, they can be substitutes in a welfare sense: the gains from trade can be captu red either through trading factors or trading goods. Second, they can be substitutes in a volume-of-trade sense: allowing for trade in factors should reduce the volume of goods trade. This Chapter investigates both of these concepts.

This do es not diminish the importance of his contribution however, and we explore that in this section. A very simple and intuitive approach to the problem is found in Jones et. al. (1986). Suppose that there is only a single produced good, X , and two factors of production, L and K . Suppose that countries h and f can only trade goods. It is clear in this very simp le model that there is no way to capture any gains from trade: the countries mu st have at least two things to trade.

The fact that factor prices are not the same in the two countries indicates that there are unexploited gains from trade, just as the inequality of commodity prices indicated unexploited gains from trade earlier in the book (e.g., Chapter 5). Free trade in factors of production starting at point E in Figure 15.1 leads to an equilibrium at point A in Figure 15.1, where the factor-price ratios of the two countries are equalized at ( w/r ) * .

Suppose, for example, that capital and X can be traded, but labor is immobile. Then home can export capital in the amount EB in Figure 15.1 to foreign.

To make the point more strongly, note that home could arrive at A by importing labor from foreign to arrive at C , which now becomes the production point. Home is now producing a lot of X which will make the critics happy.

However, there are two big assump tions underlying the factor-price-equalization theorem that we discussed in Chapter 8. First, e ndowments must be sufficiently similar such that both countries produce both goods. Second, commodity prices must be equalized by trade, ruling out any trade costs or tariffs. Let us consider the first of these. Suppose that commodity prices are equalized by trade so that the unit-value isoquants for X 1 and X 2 are in the same position for both countries as shown in Figure 15.2.

Country h has factor price ratio (w/r) h and country f has a factor-price ratio (w/r) f . Each country has a high price for its scarce factor and a relatively low price for its abundant factor. If one or both f actors are allowed to move, a country will export its abundant factor and/or import its scarce factor.

In general, these movements will displace commodity trade and hence trade in goods and factors are substitutes. However, trade in factors will allow for additional welfare gains from trade and hence adding factor trade is a welfare complement to goods trade. On the other hand, if we started with unrestricted factor trade and no goods trade, factors would be traded to the diagonal as in Figure 15.1 and there would be no add itional gains from allowing goods trade.

Suppose that country h exports X 2 (i.e., h is relatively capital abundant, as in Figures 15.2 and 15.3) and that there are trade costs for both goods.

[PAGE 263] 6 Country h has an equilibrium factor-price ratio (w/r) h while Country f has an equilibrium factor-price ratio (w/r) f . The important point is that each country has a high price for its scarce factor and a low price for its abundant factor. Indeed, we commented on this outcome in Chapter 13 on trade costs in connection with Figures 13.1 and 13.2. Figure 15.4 Now suppose that we allow trade in factors.

Consider a very different situation in which trade is caused by differences in production technologies. 2 Assume that we have two economies with the following characteristics: (1) Countries h and f have identical factor endowments; (2) Countries h and f have identical technologies for producing X 2 , but country h has superior technology for producing X 1 .

This is true in both the trade volume and welfare senses: allowing factors to move starting with equal endowments increases the volume of goods trade as well as welfare. Although this may seem to be a very special case, it is true that the complementary relationship holds for a wide variety of models in which the basis for trade is something other than differences in factor endowments.

If factor trade is introduced, factors may m ove to make countries more different in endowments than they were initially. Agglomeration can arise naturally, something quite different from a Heckscher- Ohlin world in which nothing would happen if countries are identical initially. The mathematics of some of the newer models get complicated quickly, and much is beyond the scope of the book.

It also used a single factor of production and th is type of labor may be internationally mobile. So there is no intra-country mobility but the X -sector labor may move abroad. In addition, there is an assumption that Y incurs no international trade costs and its price is equalized across countries, whereas X does incur a trade cost.

The final number actually surprises some folks as being rather small: foreign affiliate exports are only 18 percent of their total sales. Most of the output of fo reign affiliates is sold locally, a point that we must make sense of. Table 16.1 Several decades ago, foreign direct investment (FDI) was viewed as simply a capital movement. Consistent with the dominant theory of the day, Heckscher-Ohlin theory, capital should flow from capital-rich, high-income countries to capital-scarce, low-income countries.

Note that two-thirds or more of foreign output of affiliates is sold locally. Table 16.4 has data from a more restricted sample for the US and Sweden. In 2003, local sales account for 60 percent of all sales, but that still leaves a large portion for export. Columns 2 and 3 reveal, however, that most of the exports do not go back to the parent country , they go to third countries. The point is that foreign affiliates are not primarily in the business of producing cheaply abroad for shipment back to the parent: they are primary in the business of producing abroad for local and regional markets.

Therefore, fo r a firm to become a multinational, it must have offsetting advantages. A limited but very useful or ganizing framework for inquiring into the nature of these advantages was proposed by John Dunning (1977). Dunning proposed three conditions needed for firms to have a strong incentive to undertake FDI. Ownership Advantage: the firm must have a product or a production process, such that the firm enjoys some market power advantage in foreign markets. Location Advantage: the firm must have a reas on to want to locate production abroad rather than concentrate it in the home country, especially if there are scale economies at the plant level. Internalization Advantage: the firm must ha ve a reason to want to exploit its ownership advantage internally, rather than license or sell its product/process to a foreign firm.

The basic idea is shown in Figure 16.1. A firm wanting to produce in a foreign country for local sale has a location decision between producing in the foreign country or exporting to that country. We can refer to this as the \ufb01offshoring\ufb02 decision. If the multinational chooses foreign production, it has the further choice between an owned subsidiary, perhaps some sort of joint venture, or an arm\u2122s length licensing contract. We can refer to this as the intern alization or vertical inte gration versus outsourcing decision, whether or not to produce outside the ownership boundaries of the firm.

This suggests that multinationals are firms which are in tensive in the use of knowledge capital. Knowledge capital is a broad term which includes the human capital of the employees, patents, blueprints, procedures, and other proprietary knowledge, as we ll as finally marketing assets such as trademarks, reputations, and brand names. There are several reasons why the associati on of multinationals with knowledge-based assets rather than physical capital is appealing. First, the services of these assets may be easily used in distant plants, such as managers and engineers visiting tho se plants. Second, and more subtly, knowledge capital often has a joint-input or non-rivaled property within the firm.

Blueprints, chemical formulae, or even reputation capital may be very costly to produce, but once they are created, they can be supplied at relatively low cost to foreign production facilities w ithout reducing the value or productivity of those assets in existing facilities. The sources of location advantages are varied , primarily because they can differ between horizontal and vertical firms. Consider horizontal firms that produce the same goods and services in each of several locations. Given the existence of plan t-level scale economies, there are two principal sources of location advantages in a particular market. The firs t is the existence of trad e costs between that market and the MNEs home country, in the form of trans port costs (both distance and time), tariffs and quotas, and more intangible proximity advantages. The second source of location advantage, again following from the existence of plant-level scale economies, is a large market in the potential host country.

The second source of location advantage, again following from the existence of plant-level scale economies, is a large market in the potential host country. If that market is very small, it will not pay for a firm to establish a local production facility and the firm will instead service that market by exports. The sources of location advantage for vertical multin ationals are somewhat different. This type of investment is likely to be encouraged by low trad e costs rather than by high trade costs and by factor- price differences across countries. Low trade costs fac ilitate the intra-firm trade of intermediate and final goods and thus facilitate the geographic dis-integration of the production chain. Internalization advantages (or outsourcing disadvantag es) are the most abstract of the three. The topic quickly gets into fundamental issues such as what is a firm, and why and how agency problems might be better solved within a firm rather than through an arm's-length arrangement with a licensee or contractor.

Questions of outsourcing versus vertical integrati on (internalization) are left to a later section. There are two countries, home and foreign and one monopoly firm in country h.

There is a firm-specific fixed cost F and plant-specific fixed cost G where the latter must be incurred for each plant. This model thus displays firm-level scale economies: the total fixed costs of a two-plant firm are (F + 2G) which is less than the total fixed costs of two independent single-plant firms, (2F + 2G) . F thus represents the cost of creating a product or process, and this knowledge is a joint or non-rivaled input across plants.

The intuition behind the second and th ird results is that if one market is mu ch larger and/or production costs much smaller, then it pays to put a single plant there and export to the smaller/costlier market. For the third result, note that if we raise F and lower G in the same amounts, this increases the profits of a type-m firm, while leaving th e profits of a type-d or type-v firm unchanged (the horizontal curve shifts up).

Once a firm develops a product, process, or even brand identification and a reputation for quality, it can add additional plants abro ad for significantly less additional fixed costs than is incurred for setting up the firm and first plant at home.

To put it differently, higher trade costs encourage firms to be multinationals and highe r firm-level scale economies do the same. In line with our earlier discussions, we can think of high firm-level scale economies as being associated with knowledge and R&D intensive industries. Our results clearly have empirical predictions about what sort of firms should be multinationals and which industries should be domin ated by multinationals.

The knowledge-capital model is a general- equilibrium approach that incorporates both horizontal and vertical motives for multinationals.

To a good degree, the intuition is seen in Figure 16. 2 above. When one country is quite large and the other quite small, a national firm located in the large country will have an advantage since it spends little in trade costs, whereas a horizontal firm still has to bear the fixed cost of a second plant in the small country.

Figure 16.4 eliminates the possibility of vertical fi rms (the first plant mu st be located with the [PAGE 283] 9 headquarters) so only national firms and horizontal mu ltinationals can exist. Consequently, we should observe multinationals when the countries are simila r in size and in relative endowments. Figure 16.5 does the opposite, ruling out horizontal multinationals by eliminating firm-level scale economies: the fixed costs of a two-plant firm are double the fixed cost s of a single-plant firm.

On the other hand, the same characteristics that make it easy to transfer these assets make them easily learned by foreign managers, agents, or licensees. Once the agent sees the blueprint or formul a, he or she could defect to produce the product in a new firm. Knowledge is non-excludable, at least after some period of time.

The first element is the assump tion that production requires \ufb01relation-specific investments\ufb02, meaning that a multinational and a foreign individual or firm must incur sunk investments prior to production that have no outside value if the relationship breaks down.

Antr\u00e1s then presents empirical evidence, using intra-firm versus arm\u2122s-length trade, that gives good support to his model. 16.7Summary A number of empirical observations, particularly the fact that high-income countries are both the major sources but also the major recipients of mu ltina tional investment has led economists to re-think the old idea of foreign direct investment as simply capital flows, moving from where capital is abundant to where it is scarce (developing countries). A cornerstone of the new theory is the existence of firm-level (or multi-plant) economies of scale arising from the joint input or non-rivale d property of knowledge- based assets. Blueprints, processes, managerial tec hniques and so forth are costly to create but once created, can be applied to multiple plants at very low"

Blueprints, processes, managerial tec hniques and so forth are costly to create but once created, can be applied to multiple plants at very low additional cost. Comb ined with trade costs and differing fact or intensities across activities (e.g., skilled-labor intensive headquarter services versus less skilled-la bor-intensive production), knowledge-based firm scale economies generate rich models and predictions about what sort of firms will arise between what sorts of country pairs. Further, the predictions of the m odels are empirically testab le and have generated good support in formal econometric estimation. In parallel with this new learning is a literatu re on outsourcing versus vertical integration, previously termed internalization (the converse of outsourcing). In one strand of literature, the same properties of knowledge-based assets that lead firms to expand abroad in the first place create difficulties in contracting and in securing property rights over the knowledge. This can lead firm to choose vertical integration (subsidiaries) or exporting when they would, in principle, like to choose outsourcing (licensing) on the basis of cost. A more recent"

One of these is the fact th at more things seem to be traded in the last decade or two, including intermediate goods and various types of services. Indeed, twenty years ago, many trade economists defined services as more or less non-traded. A couple of terminology points first. There is a distinction between new goods and newly-traded goods. The former, of course, refer to things that simp ly did not exist before, while the latter refer to things that existed as non-traded goods or services which have now become traded. The latter is the topic of this chapter. The breaking up of the production process for a final good into different stages which are physically located in different countries has been refe rred to by a number of names, but we will use the term \ufb01fragmentation\ufb02. Vertical specialization is an alternative name for fragmentation, though this has been used in a more narrow sense.

By whatever name, trade economists have argued persuasively that much of the great increase in trade over the last d ecades has come by expansion at the extensive margin (Hummels, Rapoport, and Yi 1998; Humme ls, Ishii, and Yi 2001; Yi 2003). Often intermediate goods are produced in one or several countries, while final assembly occurs in another country. Of course, final assembly may also occur in many countries which is the stuff of horizontal multinationals discussed in Chapter 16. In many cases such as in electronics, the \ufb01upstream\ufb02 intermediates or components are more capital and skilled-labor intensive while \ufb01downstream\ufb02 assembly is less-skilled-labor intensive but there are surely exam ples which run the other way.

There are obvious advantages that fragmentation offer to the world economy. Think back to Chapter 15 where we used the concept of the facto r-price-equalization set. If the countries\u2122 endowments are outside this set, then trade in goods alone cannot exhaust all gains from trade. In that Chapter, we discussed how additional gains from trade can be capture d by allowing trade in factors. The same is true in the presence of increasing returns to scale as we di scussed in Chapter 15. Trading intermediate goods and services also allows for additional gains, and in Chapter 16 we advanced the view that multinational firms could be thought of primarily as vehicles for the intra-firm trade in services such as management, technology, marketing, and finance.

There few, if any, general welfare results about fragmentation and the expansion of trade at the extens ive margin. Specifically, it is impossible to predict that all countries will be made better off by adding more traded goods, never mind the further comp lication of factor-price changes within economies. The fundamental problem is that newly-traded [PAGE 294] 2 goods and services introduce general-equilibrium effect s such that some individual countries could be made worse off through adverse price changes. An example is taken from Markusen and Venables (2007). Suppose that our country is really good at ma king shirts, a product produced in two stages: fabric (textiles) and cut-and-sew.

In the base case, we noted that country 2 is indifferent to trading goods only and, when trade in A and C open, it remains indifferent as long as prices all remain at one. Countries 1 and 3 are not at all indifferent. They are inefficient producers of B , so at prices of unity they want to export A and C to country 2 and import finished X 1 and X 2 in exchange. This drives down the prices of A and C relative to B , which creates a welfare gain for country 2 in the middle: country 2 imports A and C cheaply from countries 1 and 2 respectively, assembles these with local intermediate B , and exports finished X 1 and X 2 to 1 and 3 respectively .

Table 17.1 also shows that it is possible, though not inevitable, that all primary factors in a country might gain: country 2 in the second column and country 1 in the third column. 17.3Fragmentation and trade in \ufb01tasks\ufb02 A recent paper by Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg ( 2008) has proposed a rather different structure which they term \ufb01tasks\ufb02.

A simplified version of thei r formulation is shown in in Figure 17.2. There are again two final goods, X 1 and X 2 and two primary factors, L and K . A task uses a single factor, either capital or labor. There are many labor tasks and many capital tasks. In our simplified version here, we assume that there are just two labor tasks, L 1 and L 2 , and two capital tasks, K 1 and K 2 . Each final good requires all labor tasks in equal amounts, and it is further assumed that there is no substitution possible among these tasks; e.g., X 1 might require exactly one unit of both L 1 and L 2 with no substitution possible. The same is true for capital tasks. Figure 17.2 Where the final goods differ is in the ratio of la bor to capital tasks, and hence there remains a Heckscher-Ohlin type of factor intensity.

X 1 is assumed to be capital intensive, requiring 65 units of each of tasks K 1 and K 2 and 35 units of each of tasks L 1 and L 2 to produce 400 units of X 1 if all prices are initially normalized at unity. X 2 is the labor-intensive mirror image: 65 units of each of tasks L 1 and L 2 and 35 units of each of K 1 and K 2 are required. There are two important differences between this and the formulation in the previous section. First, a country cannot, by definition, have a fact or-endowment ratio that is mo re extreme than some intermediate (task) that is potentially traded.

Second, if only a subset of labor or capital tasks are tradeable, then free trade in the subset is quite di fferent from simply allowing labor or capital migration, as in Chapter 15. A trabeable L task must, for example, be combined in fixed proportions with a non- tradeable domestic L tasks produced by a domestic worker. This last property is crucial in certain resu lts that Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg emphasize in their paper and so further explanation is warranted . Suppose we have a small country 1 facing fixed world prices, but it is capital abundant and specialized in X 1 , so has a wage rate higher than the rest of the world.

Capital is in fixed supply, so firms will demand more labor until the imported L 2 is equal to the domestic labor fo rce, all of whom now do task L 2 . This expansion in X 1 output will raise the relative and real price of the composite capital input (in [PAGE 297] 5 fixed supply) and lower the price of the composite la bor input.

Thus it may well be that the final price of domestic labor is higher than before task trade, and this is indeed a finding that Grossman and Rossi- Hansberg highlight. When a limited number of tasks can be traded, the domestic factor performing those tasks (competing with the imports) may be made be tter off. Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg make an interesting analogy between this trade in a limited num ber of tasks and technical change. In our simple case just discussed, the composite L task becomes cheaper at a given domestic wage rate, akin to a technical improvement in the production of the composite L task.

A simple example should suffice. Suppose that there are two goods, wheat and cars. Suppose that country 1 is generally good at car production but simply cannot pr oduce tires. Then if only final goods are traded, country 1 will be forced to export wheat in exchange for cars. Now allow tires to be traded.

The basic textbook result only proves that free trade is better for a country than autarky or, somewhat more generally, any level of restricted (but not subsidized!) trade is better than au tarky. However, there is no general result that says that more trade is better than less (but positive) trad e. This is due to the possibility of adverse price changes; e.g., further liberalization by a large country can make it worse off. However, this is exactly the type of result we are seeking here: under what conditions will the introduction of an additional set of trade possibilities to an already-existing set of traded goods improve welfare?

Similarly, Z denotes a vector of intermediate goods with prices q . In our explicit model above, X (now denoting X 1 , X 2 ) and Z (now denoting A , B , and C ) were disjoint sets. The important distinction two-fold: (a) only X goods enter into welfare-produci ng consumption and (b) we will define the absence of fragmentation to mean that goods cannot be traded for intermediate use.

Thus the domestic prices of the X goods must equal world prices. The notation that we have been using, X for production and D for consumption is now a little awkward, so we make a modification to avoid confusion. Just X and Z will be used: a subscript \ufb01 o \ufb02 on an X or Z quantity denotes production (output) of the good and a subscript \ufb01 c \ufb02 denotes consumption.

While they are not explicit barriers to trade, these policies severely increase the fixed costs (time and money) for a firm establishing commercial presence and may be prohibitive as well. It is beyond the scope of this Chapter to present a detailed analysis of these issues, but we would like readers to at least be aware of the basic id eas involved. Figure 17.3 presents a schematic of the general principles. Final consumption is assumed to be composed of two industries: manufacturing and agriculture. Business services are an intermediate input into both of these industries which also use primary factors of production, skilled and unsk illed labor. Following closely on our modeling of mu ltinational firms in the previous Chapter, business services can be decomposed into a headquarters and affiliate offices.

Banks, finance, and insurance comp anies, for example, may have a headquarters in New York or London, and have offices throughout the world. Similar to a horizontal multinational (what many services multinationals are), a firm has one headquarters but possibly many offices. Figure 17.3 Figure 17.3 notes the differences in trade in services and foreign direct investment in services. In the upper part of the chart, we note that trade in ser vices occurs when there is an international geographic separation between the service firm and the service pur chaser in agriculture or manufacturing. In the lower part of the Figure, we note that FDI in ser vices occurs when there is a geographic separation between headquarters and one or mo re offices. Either type of separation can occur without the other; for example, a horizontal firm tends to have geogra phic separation between headquarters and some offices, but not between the offices and service buyers.

As briefly discussed above, quite a range of natu ral and policy restrictions impact on whether or not it is easy and/or legal to fragment headquart ers from offices and fragment the service provider from final user. Figure 17.4 characterizes these restrictions in terms of what are know as the four modes of service trade from the World Trade Organization\u2122s GA TS: general agreement on trade in services. The schematic in Figure 17.4 has two countries, north and south, and the headquarters of a service firm headquartered in the north is represented by the central box. A possible northern office and southern office are represented by the two boxes to either side. Figure 17.4 [PAGE 303] 11 The Figure shows four possible ways in which services can be provided by the offices to north or south manufacturing and agricultural firms.

We mark this as \ufb01always feasible\ufb02 since it is a strictly domestic activity. Mode 1 of the GATS is defined as cross-border trade in services, which is the channel on the lower left of Figure 17.4: the northern office of the northern firm supplies services to southern firms. The northern firm may also have a s outhern office, which is by definition FDI in services. This is known as Mode 3 trade in services in the GATS terminology. This southern office can supply services to local firms, which is represented by the channel on the lower right of Figure 17.3. Finally, the southern office may be able to supply services to nor thern firms which would require both Modes 1 and 3 being feasible. An example of this last type of supply is call centers which are located in developing countries such as India. A customer in the north needing service from a northern firm finds their phone call"

For comp leteness, GATS mode 2 is when the buyer travels to the seller\u2122s country of origin. Traditionally, this category has been dominated by t ourism. But the extensive margin of Mode 2 is expanding as in \ufb01medical tourism\ufb02. Patients in high-income countries are finding that they can get high- quality surgery or dental work done in places as dive rse as Hungary, India, and Mexico for a fraction of the cost of having it done at home.

GATS Mode 4 is the international movement of person to work abroad, typically for limited periods of time, rather than permanent migration. There is obviously some overlap and fuzziness between this a nd Mode 3. If Gregorz the Polish plumber goes to work in Denmark, that is Mode 4; if Gregor z Plumbing Incorporated opens a one-man office in Copenhagen, that is Mode 3. As suggested earlier, both natural and policy-impo sed restrictions can make it costly or even prohibitive for a firm to engage in one or more of the modes shown in Figure 17.4. If face-to-face contact is required, for example, then Mode 1 can be prohibitiv ely costly. If countries restrict the right of foreign firms to establish or acquire local subsidiaries (known as right of establishment), then Mode 3 is difficult.

The principle of national treatment means that forei gn firms are supposed to be treated exactly the same as domestic firms, but this is often violated in prac tice (de facto) by rules requiring managers to be local citizens and so forth. Finally, arguments about classifying a barrier and its degree of restrictiveness abound between countries. Part of the difficulty is that many service industries are, by their very nature, highly regulated. Consider banking, finance, insurance, architectur e and construction, telecommunications, legal services and medical services. These tend to be regulated in all countries and while foreign firms see such regulations as barriers, the local firms and governments always tend to claim that they are non- discriminatory against foreign firms. 17.6Summary It has been documented that a good deal of the expansion of trade over the last decade or two has been through the extensive margin, meaning trad e in goods and services which were not previously traded, rather than through the intensive margin, tr ading larger quantities of the same things.

Much of this new trade seems to be in intermediate goods and services, as firms fragment the production process to take advantage of favorable factor prices or ot her considerations across geographic locations. [PAGE 304] 12 The theoretical literature on fragmentation and out sourcing is now extensive, but there is no general model on which we can rely. We presente d two special cases from recent literature that posit different mechanisms as to how we might think a bout fragmentation and newly-traded goods. These are interesting but even in these rather restrictive sp ecial cases, results still depend on choices of parameters such as country sizes and factor intensities. A simplified gains-from-trade theorem pinpoints one difficulty in trying to obtain general results. This difficulty is that, when new goods and services b ecome traded, the prices of existing goods change in general-equilibrium, which leads to terms-of-trade effects for the countries involved.

A country could lose through fragmentation because the components a nd stages of production for something the country was originally very good at can now be individually done mo re efficiently by several other countries. It is easy to create specific examples in which everyone gains but unfortunately also not impossible to create examples in which someone loses. We closed with a discussion of trade and FDI in intermediate business services, a fast-growing component of total world economic activity. The theore tical issues here are much the same as in Chapter 16 on multinational firms and the choice between e xporting and FDI. What makes trade and FDI in business services of particular interest is that many of the natural and policy barriers to trade and investment differ substantially from those restricting trade in goods.

Both of these extremes are vi rtually unheard of in practice. Instead, a country will engage in trade but the government of that country will erect various barriers to restrict trade. The mo st common of these barriers are taxes levied on the importation of foreign goods. These taxes are commonly referred to as \"tariffs,\" but they are simp ly a form of commodity taxation. Tariffs are sometimes levied on exports as well as on imports, and there are many cases where governments actively promote exports in ways that can be thought of as expor t subsidies. While there are other forms of trade restriction, this Chapter will concentrate on tariffs. Other barriers, such as import quotas, will be discussed in the following Chapter. For now, there are essentially two reasons that governments may choose to levy taxes on trade."

Other barriers, such as import quotas, will be discussed in the following Chapter. For now, there are essentially two reasons that governments may choose to levy taxes on trade. The more important objective is to protect the ope rations of domestic industries that comp ete with imports. Taking a Heckscher-Ohlin framework, for exam ple, we would expect import restrictions to be more severe in sectors that intensively use an economy' s scarce factors. In a specific-factors\u2122 framework, the tariff could protect both labor and capital owners in these import-competing industries. The second objective would be to raise revenues for the governme nt. This practice is common in many developing countries, where it is easier to tax international trad e at the border than to establish broad-based income taxes. Indeed, many exporters of primary pr oducts tax their foreign sales for revenue purposes.

Resource are transferred out of export industries, the industries in which the country has a comparative advantage, and the losses to factors of production outside the import industry exceed any gains to the latter. In a sense, failure to understand tariffs is largely a failure to understand general equilibrium. 18.2Two key equivalences A point that is to grasp is that an import tariff on X 1 is exactly equivalent to an export tax on X 2 . 2 Formally, recall that an import tariff on X 1 raises the domestic price of X 1 above the world price ( p 1 > p * 1 ) while leaving the domestic price of X 2 equal to the world price ( p 2 = p * 2 ). In ratio terms, the effect of the tariff is to set p > p * . For its part, an export tax establis hes the following relationship between the domestic price"

For its part, an export tax establis hes the following relationship between the domestic price of X 2 and the world price: p 2 = p * 2 (1 - t) . Thus, the tax drives a wedge between the domestic and world prices of X 2 ( p 2 < p * 2 ) while leaving the domestic price of X 1 equal to the world price ( p 1 = p * 1 ). In ratio terms, the effect of the export tax again is p > p * . (18.3) Thus, an import tariff and an export tax have the sam e effect on the domestic price ratio, and since it is only the ratio that matters, both have the same eff ect on production, consumption, and factor prices (income distribution).

Equivalence 1: An import tariff on one good is e quivalent to an export tax on the other good. It generally seems hard to convince people of this result and we are not sure why. Often, the conjecture is that an import tariff and an export subs idy do the same thing, but this is completely wrong. An export subsidy, which we will return to in a minute will expand trade above the free-trade level, whereas an import tariff will clearly reduce trade as shown in Figure 18.1. A second important equivalence is that an import tariff is equivalent to the combined policy of a consumption tax on the import good and a production subsidy for that good. A tariff is a double distortion, distorting both the consumer and the produ cer decisions. Consider again equation (18.1) and for emphasis let the consumer price of"

They receive the world price p* plus the subsidy payment p*t.

This is shown in Figure 18.2. X t and D t are again the production and consumption points under a tariff. But if we only distort production with a production subsidy rather than a tariff, then consumers face the true world prices and can make an optimal decision. In this case, consumers will choose point D * which is on the world price ratio through X t so that trade balances, but their marginal rate of substitution is equal to the true world price ratio.

Figure 18.2 There is one important caveat to this argumen t. The tariff raises revenue for the government whereas the subsidy costs the government expenditures. This can be a problem when the public (not to mention the government itself) does not appreciate gene ral equilibrium. However, even for the trained economist, the argument for the superiority of the tariff rests on the assumption that some other non- distortionary tax can be used to raise the funds for the subsidy. In many if not most cases, there is no such alternative policy and hence the tariff, bad as it is, might be better. In fact, many developing countries use tariffs to raise revenue and not primarily for protecting domestic industries (many tariffs are on goods not produced domestically) because they are administratively easy to use and less distortionary than alternatives.

The fact that both policies are bad follows from an earlier proof in Chapter 2 showing the efficiency of the competitive ec onomy: free market trade is just right. An export subsidy s on good X 2 can be written as follows: (18.4) Figure 18.3 shows the effects of an export subsidy on X 2 for a small economy facing fixed world prices.

This possibility is an application of what is known in economics as the \"theory of the second best.\" There are two equivalent versions of this general proposition; one is just the contra-positive of the other. Second best 1: in the present of one (or more) distortions, adding a further distortion that acts to offset the first one can improve welfare. Second best 2: in the presence of more than one distortion, removing one of the distortions can make the country worse off. Figure 18.7 presents an example of this.

This will raise the producer price of X 1 and shift the economy around the production frontier to X t . This is a positive outcome: the tariff is, in part, a production subsidy to X 1 as discussed earlier and thus is an offsetting distortion to the external economies distortion.

Yet it surely is the case that there are market failures, particularly in developing countries. Often under-developed capital markets means that the private cost of funds does exceed the social costs (e.g., rates of interest paid on government bonds). Another source of market failures, related in some ways to external economies, are termed coordination failures.

[PAGE 321] 12 18.7Effective protection One fundamental prediction from the theory thus far is that a tariff provides protection from imports, encouraging expanded domes tic production of the protected commodity. Implicitly, this theory assumes that the tariff is the only tax that directly a ffectscosts and prices of the good in question. Such an assumption is sensible for goods that are produced sole ly by non-traded primary inputs, such as capital and labor, and for goods that require intermediate inputs that are freely traded internationally. However, most commodities are produced with the use of interm ediate goods that are themselves subject to trade taxes. Thus, for example, a tariff on imported steel would raise costs and lower output in the automobile sector. In general, a manufacturer will be better off th e higher are tariffs on imports"

The term \"effective protection\" refers to the fact that all such tariffs need to be taken in to account in computing the net protective effect of the tariff structure as a whole. Because our concern is to take into account interm ediate inputs, the notion of effective protection actually refers to the positive or negative stimulus to value added in production of a commodity. Value added per unit of output, v , is the difference between the price of a final good and the cost of purchasing intermediate inputs. As such, it measures the portion of the value of output that is available for payments to primary inputs.

Value added thus captures the costs of primary input s. In this case, value added makes up 33% of the gross value of the car. If the tariff structure comb ines to expand value added relative to free trade, it effectively raises pay ments to these primary factors.

Hyper-efficient tariffs with no administrative costs return the revenue to the consumer and use no real resources.

Hence p*t is the Ricardian rent per unit of imports and is the total Ricardian rents created by the restriction. Ricardian rents are similar to profits arising, for example, from the restrictions of output by a monopolist that we studied earlier. The difference is important in many contexts. Ricardian rents arise from scarcity value and the term is generally used to apply in situations where that scarcity is not due to market power. Take, for example, land in urban ar eas. Land close to the city center is in scarce supply relative to more distant land and hence the closer land commands a much higher price than in the hinterland.

Thus the point illustrated in Figure 19.1 is a very general idea that applies in many areas of economics. In the tariff case, we just assume that the tari ff revenue goes to the government, though corruption might leave to some diversion of those revenues to certain individuals.

A simple declaration (thou shalt not...) is probably not going to work. The typical way that a quota works is by the government issuing some sort of licenses. The importer of a good can pay the world price for th e good, but must also surrender a license to import to the customs\u2122 inspector at the port. Le t\u2122s attack this question by way of example.

One could argue that at least this method keeps the rents inside the country and that it only differs from the quota auction in the distribution of rents among firms and individuals in the country. The same thing could, of course, occur with a tariff if the tari ff revenues are given to favored individuals or firms.

Suppose again that the ta riff and the quota are initially set to be equivalent. Under a tariff, the equilibrium will slide up or dow n the domestic demand curve leading to changes in both price and quantity. Under a quota, an increase in the world price will simply raise or lower the quota rent.

With a quota, the domestic firm can now raise the domestic price by cutting supply, since consumers cannot buy any more from the foreign competitive [PAGE 336] 7 suppliers. Thus the quota confers market power on the domestic monopolist where there was none before. Another thing that has been documented in the lite rature is the tendency or incentive for foreign suppliers to engage in quality upgrading under a quota as opposed to a tariff.

Once again, quotas come off very mu ch worse in the comparison. Suppose that the home country puts on an import quota with licenses distributed by auction. The incentives for the foreign country are now much like the situation with a foreign monopoly supplier just discussed (the foreign government now takes on the role of the monopoly supplier).

Certain actions by the governments in question are designed to give domestic firms important advantages over foreign rivals in competing for international business. These actions often involve some direct or i ndirect form of subsidy, which lowers the costs of the domestic firms relative to their competitors. Although such subsidies or other forms of support may increase profits of the national firms, analysis in previous chapters (e.g., Chapter 10) s hould warn us that this in no way implies that such subsidies are welfare improving for the country.

On the other hand, the fact that we know that large, imperfectly-competitive firms are \"under producing\" (producing outputs for which price exceeds marginal cost) might make us suspect that measures to stimulate the production and sales of large domestic firms might possibly be welfare improving. From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, a large numbe r of scientific papers were produced which examined trade policies, such as tariffs and quot as, under conditions of imperfect competition and increasing returns to scale. This has become known as the \"strategic trade policy\ufb02 literature, for better or for worse.

In this chapter, we will examine a number of special cases in order to get a flavor of the strategic trade-policy literature, and hopefully obtain some understanding of what sorts of environmen ts produce what results.

The consequence of this weird assumption is that it makes changes in prof its of the nation's firm (minus subsidy payments) equivalent to changes in welfare. There is no conflict between a higher price increasing profits but reducing domestic consumers' welfare. The job of th e government is very simple: assist the domestic firm [PAGE 341] 2 in the international market place, and help the fi rm earn the maximu m possible profits (Spencer and Brander, 1985 Brander and Spencer 1983).

This might seem a relatively harmless change, but in fact it reverses the result of the previous section. The home government's optimal policy is to tax the home firm, not subsidize it (Eaton and Grossman 1985). Under the assumptions of linear demand and consta nt marginal cost, the outcome of Bertrand competition is more competitive than Cournot. Bertrand competitors produce more than Cournot competitors, and the equilibrium price and firm prof its are lower than under Cournot. A tax by the home government can restraint Bertrand competition, and ther eby reduce profits of the Home firm by less than the resulting tax revenue. Home welfare increases.

The identical X goods are freely traded so there is a single world price p as before, given by (20.14) with profits of firm X h given by (20.15) Marginal revenue minus marginal cost for firm i in country h is given by differentiating (20.15) with respect to X i , holding all other X h outputs and all X f outputs constant.

But empirically, there is widely-spread in ternational equity owners hip of large, oligopolistic firms and so part of their profit income goes to forei gners.

The ability of firm to price discriminate across international markets comes up in many other trade-policy controversies, such as whether or not para llel trade is allowed. Parallel trade basically allows independent firms to arbitrage goods from where they are cheap to where they are expensive without the permission of the original manufacturing firm (e.g., US pharmaceutical products are cheaper in Mexico than in the US).

Import protection as export promotion Another interesting example of the strategi c use of export subsidies occurs when the marginal cost of production, as well as average cost, is decreasing (Krugman, 1984) with higher output. Suppose that a home firm and a foreign rival are each selling in their own markets, exporting to their rival's market, and perhaps selling in third countries. A ssume that marginal cost decreases with the amount produced. Now assume that the foreign country erects a tr ade barrier (a tariff or quota) to imports of the home-country product. The effect of the foreign trade barrier is to rest rict the foreign market for its domestic firm, or at least to give that firm a larger share of the domestic market.

Thus there will be further ramifications of the foreign trade barrier in that the foreign fi rm will now be more competitive in the home country\u2122s market and in third country markets. Conversely, the home firm will be less competitive in its own market and third-country markets. The equilibrium condition of marginal revenue equa ls marginal cost now implies that the foreign firm will expand sales in the home country\u2122s market a nd in third countries, and that home firm\u2122s sales will shrink.

Krugman also shows that this argument holds up when the scale economies are in the form of dynamic learning-by-doing, in which marginal cost s of production fall with accumulated sales experience. Protecting or reserving the home market for the domestic firm allows that firm to lower its costs mo re quickly and therefore, to compete more effectively in export markets. By reserving their domestic market for domestic firms, the protecting country can develope a more competitive industry than would occur strictly through market forces (Baldwin and Krugman 1988).

These authors both raise the possibility that a voluntary export restraint imposed by home on the foreign exporter of some good competing in a duopoly with a home firm may lead to an increase in the profits of both firms. A Bertrand duopoly model is used, much like that developed in Section 20.3 above.

Trade Policy in monopolistic-competition models Strategic trade policy questions have also b een examined in monopolistic-competition models of the type introduced in Chapter 12. Flam a nd Helpman (1987) show that a tariff on imported, differentiated goods improves welfare, both due to th e usual optimal-tariff argument (the tariff improves the terms of trade) and because consumer expenditure is shifted to domestic substitute products, produced with increasing returns to scale. This leads to a be neficial expansion in the domestic increasing-returns sector.

An imported machine and a domestic computer may be complements in production, for example. Markusen shows that if the imported and domestic differentia ted products are general-equilibrium complements, then an import tariff may reduce welfare. The tariff generates a favorable terms-of-trade effect, but the increased prices of the imported (producer) goods may ge nerate a fall in demand for and production of the domestic inputs produced with increasing returns to scale. This can generate a negative \"production expansion effect\" that outweighs the favorable terms- of-trade effect. Once again, we see that appropriate policy depends very much on the underlying structure of the economy. 20.6Summary This Chapter has presented some examples of why scale economies and imperfect competition may give governments an incentive to assist strategica lly their domestic firms in international markets.

We noted that such subsidies are not optimal in models based on constant returns to scale and perfect competition. Domestic welfare deteriorat es as a consequence of production or export subsidies [PAGE 350] 11 and the only beneficiaries are foreign consumers who can buy cheaper imports. Scale economies and imperfect competition imply an excess of price (the value of a good to consumers) over marginal cost (the value of resources needed to produce an additional unit) . In such a situation, there is an incentive for governments to stimulate production.

Arguments in favor of subsid ies must, therefore, be very carefully evaluated in light of industry structure and other variables and assumptions. At the present time, the theory offers little support for a comprehensive government program to support its domestic firms in the international marketplace. Some specific findings are as follows. When a home firm is competing with a foreign rival for sales to third markets, the home government can shift oligopoly rents in favor of the home firm with a production or export subsidy .

Here, we see quite clearly why the traditional argument against production or export subsidies following from a comp etitive model may be reversed. With price in excess of marginal cost, an expansion in the output of the imperfectly-competitive, increasing-returns sector is beneficial and conversely a contraction is harmful. A small production subsidy can improve domestic welfare. However, this reversal of the conventional comp e titive result can be reversed back again if firms are allowed to enter or exit in response to policy changes.

In some cases, domestic and foreign markets are linked in a way that produces interesting implications for strategic trade policy. If marginal costs are declining or if firms are initially operating near zero profits, then the imposition of import protecti on in the foreign country can lead to ramifications back in the home country. This protection reserves the foreign market for foreign firms, giving them advantages in terms of lower marginal costs or forc ing the exit of home firms from the market.

They generate a favorable terms-of-tra de effect, and lead to a beneficial expansion by domestic increasing-returns firms. This conclusion can be reversed however, if the imported goods are general-equilibrium complements for the domestic increasing-returns goods. In such a case, the higher import prices may lead to reduced production of the domestic goods, generating a welfare-reducing contraction in domestic increasing-returns production.

The answer that economists focus on primarily is the fact that large countries can gain welfare at the expense of their trading partners by imposing a tariff. As described in Chapter 18, a country with significant monopsony power in trade faces a welfare tradeoff when it raises a tax on impor ts: the volume of trade is diminished, reducing economic efficiency and well-being, but the forei gn export price is pushed dow n, improving the country\u2122s terms of trade.

The difficulty, of course, is that the exporting country or countries are made worse off because the tariff reduces the price their goods receive in trade. As a result, these countries may choose to retaliate with their own tariffs, since doing so would tend to re-balance the terms of trade back in their favor. The net result would be lower trade volumes but a largely unchanged international price ratio, which would likely make all countries worse off comp ared to global free trade. This basic logic may be seen in Figure 21.1, which extends the analysis in Figure 18.4.

In brief, this kind of reaction could significantly reduce the amount of trade while having little net impact on the terms of trade. Global welfare would be smaller and both countries likely would lose. Figure 21.1 Figure 21.1 does not depict a full policy equilibrium for two reasons. First, it is evident that the home country may react to foreign\u2122s tax by changing its tariff yet again, and foreign may respond to that change, and so on in a multiple-stage game.

Suppose now that foreign has a small positive tariff. Recalling the analysis in Section 18.5, home\u2122s best response would depend on the VT losses versus TT gains it would achie ve by altering its own import tax, assuming the foreign tariff is fixed. 2 For a small foreign tariff, home is likely to raise its own tax because the TT gains would apply to a large volume of imports, while the e fficiency loss would be relatively small.

For example, the contour at point B shows that if both tariff rates were on that cu rve but to the left and below the horizontal point, if foreign were to raise its tariff, then home could do so also and retain the same welfare. A final observation is that home\u2122s welfare rises as it moves down and to the right on its best-response function (the optimal tariff is its maximum welfare).

To maximize global (two-country) welfare, negotiations should achieve a point on the contract curve CC, along which the iso- welfare contours for both countries are tangent to each other. 4 In particular, the outcome at reciprocal free trade (point T) is both globally welfare-improving (com pared to N) and Pareto-efficient. We depict this fact by showing tangency at point T, which arises because home and foreign share the same (free-trade) price ratio.

Before leaving this section, however, we might ask what other reasons might induce governments choose unilaterally to impose high trade taxes, gene rally to the detriment of their economies. For example, the standard terms-of-trade model offers no explanation for why small countries, which cannot affect world prices, often have high trade barriers.

However, it is quite possi ble that she would favor protection if there are multiple ballot issues to consider and the intensity of preferences varies across voters and issues, or if the distributional outcomes of trade policy are uncertain.

In turn, mutually agreed trade liberalization can ra ise national and global welfare, with the same logic as above. Political-economic pressures do raise at least tw o interesting additional policy complications, however. First, because trade liberalization exposes import-competing industries to competition it may be difficult simply to move quickly and sustainably from the protected equilibrium to free trade. Rather, trade agreements generally phase in their tariff cuts gradually to give firms and workers an opportunity to anticipate the needs to adjust. 7 Moreover, as we will describe in the next section, agreements generally offer various safety valves that may permit tem porary reimposition of trade protection under certain circumstances.

First is a set of negotiated agreements to liberalize internationa l trade and establish obligations preventing member governments from violating their commitments to open markets. These agreements are based on fundamental principles and mutually agreed rules of behavior. Indeed, the WTO is often called a rules- based approach to mu ltilateral trade cooperation. S econd is an organizational secretariat, located in Geneva, Switzerland, that facilitates enforcement of these obligations and supports ongoing multilateral trade negotiations among members. It is important to note that the organization\u2122s policies and procedures are determined by mutual agreement among countries, not by the WTO\u2122s staff.

Thus, domestic taxes and regulations cannot be biased against foreign goods. The second [PAGE 365] 13 All these provisions mean that each WTO member actually has up to five tariff schedules, which list tariff rates for each product.

It extends also to NTBs and regulations, implying that a favorable tax offered to firms from one nation must be offered to firms from all others. In essence, MFN ensures that all international competitors are treated equally at the border and NT guarantees that ther e is no favoritism shown domestic firms inside the border. The MFN principle carries strong economic advantag es over a policy of bilateral discrimination. It permits comparative advantage to be the prim ary determinant of trade patterns, raising global efficiency. It makes negotiations on reducing trade restrictions easier because it requires that each country set just a single schedule of MFN import taxes ra ther than a series of bilateral tariff rates.

Without this principle, countries would be free to negotiate bilateral tariff agreements and exercise their market power, resulti ng in less liberalized and more fragmented world trade. There are four major exceptions to the MFN rule . The most prominent is that the WTO permits groups of countries to form preferential trading arra ngements, such as free trade agreements and customs unions, which we analyze in the next chapter. The primary requirement is that such agreements do not impose tariffs and regulations on the goods from exclude d countries that are higher or mo re restrictive than those already existing.

This restriction has rarely been invoked by the GATT or WTO to deny the formation of a new trade agreement. 13 A second exception is that developed countries ar e encouraged to provide favorable tariff treatment of goods from the developing countries by adopting a Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). As poor countries achieve higher income leve ls and increase their trade volumes they are often graduated out of the GSP and then face MFN tariffs . The third departure from MFN is that groups of like-minded countries have negotiated certain side agreements, commonly called Codes, which obligate only the Code signatories to treat each other without discrimination. For example, there is a Code on Government Procurement, applying mostly to developed economies, which establishes rules for governments to accept bids from domestic and forei gn firms for various public contracts.

Reciprocity The second fundamental principle of the WTO is reciprocity. In particular, multilateral trade negotiations are reciprocal; countries agree to lower their tariffs or relax NTBs in return for other [PAGE 366] 10 countries doing the same. Purely in economic terms we might question the need for reciprocity, since nations generally gain welfare by liberalizing trade. However, as analyzed above, it may be necessary for large countries to agree jointly to reduce barriers in order to move away from the Nash equilibrium. Reciprocity is also necessary to induce concessions by all participants.

Through the Toky o Round, many developing countries were seen by some observers as \ufb01free riders\ufb02 in this sense and a la rge emphasis in the Uruguay Round was gaining full participation. Similarly, when a new country joins the WTO it will immediately gain MFN status. Existing members therefore require, through negotiati ons, that a new entrant engage in considerable market liberalization as part of its \ufb01entry fee\ufb02. Most fundamentally, reciprocity is necessary to achieve domestic political support for opening markets to trade. That policy will be opposed by import-competing industries and scarce factors, both of which must adjust to greater competition. However, if foreign countries are also cutting tariffs there will be greater opportunities for export expansion and export-oriented industries will lobby for trade agreements, offsetting the status-quo political pressures.

This leaves WTO members little room to bargain unless they turn to difficult and contr oversial issues of liberalizing service markets and changing commercial regulations. Th is is another major reason for th e continuing failure of the Doha Round. Enforceability The third basic WTO principle is that commitments and obligations must be enforceable. Trade agreements would have little value or staying power if countries could easily go back on their tariff cuts or violate essential rules. For example, we noted above that memb er countries actually negotiate tariff bindings , or ceilings above which they commit not to raise import duties.

These negotiated cuts then must be offered to other me mbers under the MFN principle, which raises the political costs of choosing to violate the bindings. The more familiar enforcement element is the dispute settlement process of the WTO. Keep in mind that the WTO agreements embody far more than just tariff bindings. There are basic obligations (eg, MFN and NT), limits on government behavior (eg, bans on export subsidies and rules governing antidumping duties), policy standards (eg, intellect ual property protection a nd public-health regulations applied to imports) and other kinds of market-access commitments (eg, establishment rights in services).

These disputes are highly complex and both sides present legal arguments about whether the offending behavior is, in fact, a violation of some commitment and results in economic damages to the complainant nation. Afte r hearing these arguments, the panel issues a ruling, which may be appealed. If the ruling finds that th e defendant nation has violated its commitments, the panel can order that country to modify or stop the offense.

Under the GATT it was relatively ineffective at changing behavior for a number of reasons. For example, a country that \ufb01lost\ufb02 a pane l ruling could simply block it from being released and did not really have to comply with recommende d policy modifications. That is, the GATT had no authority to require a change in policy, since the agreement relied solely on voluntary compliance.

Relief mechanisms A final major principle of the WTO is that countries must have some safety valves to manage pressures that are inevitable in the system. Fo r example, under WTO rules countries may use trade measures under certain circumstances to protect pub lic health, deal with monopolies, and conserve exhaustible natural resources, among other \ufb01non-ec onomic\ufb02 objectives. Such trade measures cannot be discriminatory or disguised restrictions on internati onal trade. In order to protect national security, countries may also adopt trade restrictions, whic h are not subject to these limitations.

This is ty pically done by nondiscriminator y increases in tariffs on specific products beyond their bound rates. These actions, referred to as safeguards , have two important features. First, the rules state that such protection is to be temporary, lasting onl y as long as needed to remedy the injury. For example, safeguards tariffs used in the United States have of ten have been subject to a declining schedule over time. Second, because such actions violate the its commitment not to raise tariffs, the importing country is required to pay some compensation to foreign na tions that stand to lose business.

Immediately, several countries asked for consultation over removing the tariffs, which the US government refused to do.

Safeguards permit protection against unanticipated import surges that result from ordinary market activity, or \ufb01fair competition\ufb02. Largely because of th e compensation and retaliation features, such tariffs are rarely imposed. Another key reason is that it is easier to raise duties against imports considered to be \ufb01unfair comp etition\ufb02. There are two categories of unfairly traded imports. First are goods that are \ufb01dumped,\ufb02 or sold in a market by a foreign firm at an unfairly low price. The importing government can respond to these prices with antidumping duties (ADD).

Because these two types of tariffs are imposed in response to particular forms of trade behavior, they are jointly referred to as contingent protection . An interesting analytical question is why firms engage in dumping. Again, there are two legal definitions of dumping. The first entails a firm selli ng its product in an export market at a price below the price of the same good in its home market. At a surface level this behavior seems odd since we would expect foreign sales to be priced sufficiently to cove r the additional transport costs. However,"

At a surface level this behavior seems odd since we would expect foreign sales to be priced sufficiently to cove r the additional transport costs. However, examples of such pricing are common. The second definition pe rtains where a product is sold in an export market at a price below the average cost of producing it. Importing countries generally equate average cost with the \ufb01fair value\ufb02 of the product and dumping constitutes sales at less than fair value (LTFV). Selling at a price below average cost also seems unprofitable on its face, so why might firms do this? One possibility is that firms could experience an unexpected reduction in demand in their home market and, rather than cut production, choose to export their surplus output to foreign markets at a discount. This strategy could emerge in count ries experiencing an economic recession, for example, which is why it is sometimes called cyclical dumping . If importers experience lower output and employment as a result, countering it with temporary AD duties is sensible, both economically and politically."

A second possibility is that a foreign firm may engage in predatory dumping , which means selling its goods in an export market at a price low enough to drive competing firms out of business or deter entry by other firms. This would require se tting a price so low that competitors could not cover variable costs and would ultimately leave the market . Such fears offer the greatest political motivation for ADD, as domestic firms use them to lobby for protectionist antidumping laws. If predatory behavior exists it harms competition and importing governments are justified in levying an offsetting tariff. Again, however, there is little evidence of predatory dumping, largely because of the costs of sustaining it.

Moreover, preda tion is illegal under the antitrust laws of most countries and firms would likely be prosecuted if they attempted it. This leaves the third, and primary, reason for dum ping, which can be explained by the theory of international trade under imperfect competition. Suppose that firms produce differentiated goods, so each has some monopoly power in each country in which it sells. Recall from chapter 12 that a monopolist would maximize profits by setting a price in each market j (including her own home market) as a markup over marginal costs: (21.1) /(11/) j jj pmc In this expression, marginal cost includes the co st of transporting an additional good to market j.

This practice is called international price discrimination and is quite likely to occur in many differentiated products and markets. 18 Note for this outcome to hold there must be two further market features beyond imperfect comp etition. The first is that countries have pref erences that generate different demand elasticities. While there are many reasons for such differences, two primary factors were mentioned in Chapter 14. Countries generally exhibit home bias in consumption, which would s upport more inelastic demand, and higher prices, for domestic goods. Further, the pr ice sensitivity of consumers for certain goods may depend on incomes.

The idea here extends that to the possibility that preferences of higher-income consumers (countries) also are less price-elastic. 20 The United States, for example, prohibits parallel imports of products that are protected by domestic patents and copyrights. The EU also prohib its such imports from outside its region but they are permitted among the memb er countries. See Ganslandt and Maskus (2008) for details. 16 and digital products, permitting firms to charge them higher prices. 19 The second critical feature is that different markets mu st be partially or fully segme nted (that is, isolated from one another) so that consumers or distributors in one country will not buy the good at a low price and resell it in other markets at higher prices.

However, in many countries this trade is illegal, which is the most important reason that markets for differentiated goods are segmented. 20 How do these features generate dumping incentives for firms? First, if the home market has higher per-capita income than the export market, dema nd could be more elastic in the latter, inducing a lower price there. Next, home bias suggests that pr ices are likely to be higher in home markets than abroad, itself a feature of dumping. Interestingly, in a two-country world if home bias existed in both locations, then imperfectly comp etitive firms in each, possibly producing quite similar products, would sell in the other at a lower price.

It generally would not call for an ADD response since there is no distortion to offset with the tariff. Interestingly, an extreme version of this possi bility can exist even without home bias and product differentiation. Suppose, as in Chapter 11, two oligopolistic firms produce a homogeneous good but they perceive the home and foreign markets to be segmented , rather than fully integrated. In this case, with Cournot competition, each firm will actually export its good to the other market in order to take advantage of the demand ther e.

There is also the secondary problem that limited regulation can reduce production costs and give domestic firms a compe titive advantage over foreign firms. The secondary problem is manifested in altered trade patterns, w ith companies in the country with weaker regulations exporting more (and facing less import competition) than would be the case if they were required to pay the environmental costs of these emissions.

These co mplexities raise several analy tical challenges for economists. First, while basic trade theory points to global efficiency and welfare gains from mutually free trade, this is not necessarily the case in other areas of regulation. For example, there is no meaningful definition of \ufb01free trade\ufb02 in intellectua l property rights, such as patents.

It may not be possible to predict confid ently whether restricting or liberalizing trade would be welfare-improving. For example, as we will descr ibe in the next section, some evidence suggests that reducing trade barriers can offset the distortionary effects of poor environmental regulations sufficiently to improve air quality.

As usual, let home import good x 1 , foreign import good x 2 , and the price ratio reflect the relative price of x 1 . Home\u2122s import demand depends on domestic price, which is a function of the tariff and world price, and on its standard, and similarly for forei gn. Balanced trade between the countries determines world price, an increase (decrease) in which raises (redu ces) home\u2122s (foreign\u2122s) welfare. This means that, while each country sets its own tariff and standard, its welfare depends indirectly on the policy choices set by the other.

The next question is whether, if countries set their policies unilaterally, the non-cooperative Nash choices would meet these efficiency criteria. Each government would choose policies to maximize domestic well-being, assuming the other country\u2122s polici es are held constant.

These elements of the WTO raise concerns in the minds of many observers about the individual sovereignty of member nations to manage their ow n economies. This is perhaps the largest objection many have to global trading rules. As written, th is interface between trade policy and domestic regulation is powerful yet relatively small in scope. The WT O Agreements have no direct control over government policies except for tariffs, nontariff barriers, trade s ubsidies and intellectual property rights. That is, member nations have chosen not to include discip lines on most standards and regulations, except to the extent they unjustifiably interfere with nego tiated market access. There are no rules governing environmental standards, banking re gulations, labor rights, or antitrust policy, to name several critical areas.

It is conceivable that negotiations could be undertaken across two or more disparate areas, with this \ufb01cross-issue bargaining\ufb02 potentially generating wider economic gains. This possibility was one reason given for bringing intellectual propert y rights into the WTO. Most trade economists, however, agree that the WTO, as a compact desi gned to facilitate global commerce in goods, does not have sufficient competency to cover these broa der elements of domestic regulation. 21.6 Empirical Evidence A number of empirical questions have been posed about global trade liberalization. For example, trade economists study the potential gains from mu ltilateral trade negotiations, such as the ongoing Doha Round, through computational general equilibrium models of the global economy.

In this section we review two other questions. Fi rst, is it really true that membership in the GATT and WTO has increased trade volumes significan tly? Second, how does trade liberalization seem to affect environmental quality? WTO membership and trade volumes Given the importance of multilateral trade, it seems self-evident that countries that have been members of the GATT and WTO must trade more than countries that have not. However, a controversial study by Rose (2004) could not find such evidence.

The primary dummy variables of interest indicated whether both countries were in the GATT or WTO, or whether just one was. The sample covered 178 countries between 1948 and 1999, a period during which many countries were not in the GATT in the earlier decades. Some countries, such as China and Russia, were not in the GATT or WTO during this period, l eaving them as the \ufb01control group\ufb02 in the regressions. The basic OLS regressions found that the standard gravity determinants of trade worked well to explain bilateral trade volumes.

A series of additional regressions were run to check how robust these findings were. Rose added country-pair fixed effects, estimated the regression fo r different periods, and broke down the coefficients by region and income class, among other tests. In general, his basic finding persisted. The author concluded that the simple act of belonging to the GATT/WTO had little impact on trade flows.

Those memb er countries that actively engaged in reciprocal tariff cuts and other market-access commitments during the GATT/WTO years presumably should have experienced more trade growth than those that did not. Similarly, countries with a large production share in goods that were not subject to much trade liber alization, specifically agriculture and textiles and apparel, should have seen less trade growth. In fact , during the period studied most of the mutual tariff cuts were made by developed countries in indus trial goods, while developi ng economies were often exempt from such cuts due to special and differen tial treatment.

Simply joining the global system, without actively engaging in mutual tariff liberalization, did not raise the trade volumes of developing nations. It is important to note that one of the key principles of the Uruguay Round, which founded the WTO, was to phase out the special treatment for developing countries and hold them to effective trade liberalization.

To organize this question, consider the framewo rk set out in Antweiler, Copeland and Taylor (2001), which we depict graphically in Figure 21.5.

Then total emissions are G = e( )x 1 . Good x 2 imposes no such externality. Then in Figure 21.5 the production frontier shows the net output of x 1 for all feasible outputs of x 2 . The downward-sloping lines in the bottom panel reflect the relationship between emissions and output. Because of the pollution tax and import tariff the relative producer price of x 1 in home is below that in the rest of the world and the initial output equilibrium is at point A, with p* > p h .

If we again hold the pollution policy constant, this scale effect is the shift from OG B to OG S . Again, this impact must raise emissions because we produce more of the dirty good at constant factor intensities. The third component, called the technique effect , arises from an income-induced change in policy that reduces emissions intensity. Because real nationa l income is higher, it is likely that the government would raise the pollution tax. One reason is that voter preferences for a cleaner environment tend to increase with higher income, an assumption that is well supported in the empirical literature (Grossman and Krueger, 1993).

The technique effect is then the emissions fall from to OG S to OG C , which cuts pollution. While we have shown an overall cut in pollution, it is clear that the total impact of tariff cuts, even in a country that exports the dirty commodity, is ambiguous. The composition and scale effects expand pollution, while the technique effect, arisi ng indirectly from more rigorous regulation as income expands, brings emissions down. Thus, empirical ev idence should shed light on this question, as studied by Antweiler, Copeland and Taylor (2001).

Concentrations are not the same as emissions, since the former depend on weather conditions and other factors. The authors assumed that concentrations were linearly related to underlying emissions. This permitted them to regress the log of SO 2 concentrations on variables explaining emissions from the theory, along with several interaction terms. Central explanatory variables included SCALE (local GDP per square kilo meter in each city), KL (the national capital-to- labor endowment ratio), INC (lagged per-capita GNP in the country), and TI (trade intensity, the ratio of exports plus imports to GDP in each nation). The fi nal variable was taken as a proxy variable for trade restrictions, assuming that mo re closed economies woul d have lower trade ratios.

The first variable, SCALE, captures the effect of city size, holding constant trade openness and the c ountry capital-labor ratios. It has a significantly positive effect on concentrations (emissions), as antic ipated. The scale elasticity suggests that a one- percent increase in local economic size raises pollution by about 0.27 percent. The next variable is the capital-labor ratio, which directly expands concen trations. Thus, countries with higher capital-labor ratios, and therefore a larger proportion of output in capital-intensive goods, emit mo re concentrated SO 2 .

The composition elasticity [PAGE 380] 24 listed takes account of both the direct impact and all these interactions (computed at sample means). Overall, then, an increase of one percent in the average country\u2122s capital abundance, holding scale and income constant, generates an increase in SO 2 concentrations of one percent.

Because such arrangements are often made on a regional basis, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), they are often referred to as regional trade agreements. The number of PTAs in the world has grown markedly in recent years. As of May 15, 2011 there were 297 PTAs in force, according to the WTO. Preferential trade agreements may be usefully classified in terms of their scope. Many are partial PTAs , in which countries simply reduce tariffs, perhaps to zero, on a limited schedule of goods.

One important implication is that countries in an FTA mu st negotiate rules of origin , which define terms under which a good is certified to have been produced in the region and therefore eligible for free trade. Otherwise non-member countries would simply export their goods to the lowest-tax member and then tran sship the goods to their ultimate destinations. These rules can be highly comp lex and sometimes may be an impediment to trade themselves (Hoekman and Kostecki, 2009).

Finally, some countries may choose to go bey ond a customs union to the mutu al elimination of barriers to capital and labor movements. This form of trade policy coordination is called a common market . The European Union, also called the European Economic Community, is the primary example of a common market. Its members share a common external tariff (CET) and are required to permit the free flow of labor and capital.

Put differently, the preferential tariffs ar tificially discriminate against some suppliers in favor of others. The immediate implication is that a participant in a PTA could gain or lose welfare. This simple insight is illustrated in Figure 22.1, where we depict country A to be a small importer of good x 1 .

This is an example of trade creation , which we may define as additional trade coming from a partner country as a result of the preferential trade liberalization. At the same time, the prior volume of imports had come from R whereas now they are purchased from B. This is the result of trade diversion , which is the reduction of imports from a lower-cos t supplier outside the preferential region in favor of imports from a higher-cost supplier inside it. 1 Figure 22.1 A second approach is to use the language of Chapte r 18.

In general, demand-side complex ities imply that the economic effects of FTAs depend on numerous market parameters. 3 [PAGE 395] 4 There are numerous other possibilities that could be considered in a full accounting of the trade and welfare impacts of a preferential trade agreement involving many goods and countries. Among the more important are the effects on the internal term s of trade (price changes within the PTA) and the external terms of trade (price changes on goods from out side the region), the interrelationships of tariff cuts with other taxes in an economy, and how th e formation of PTAs influences capital formation and FDI.

However, a particular formation was set out by Kemp and Wan (1976) that suggests gains are available to all members of a customs union. Recall that a customs union (CU) is an agreement among a set of countries to offer zero tariffs to each other but establish the same set of tariffs against non-members. These common external tariffs (CET) offer the key to the welfare result. The Kemp-Wan Theorem may be stated as follo ws. Consider a customs union among any set of countries. There exists a"

The Kemp-Wan Theorem may be stated as follo ws. Consider a customs union among any set of countries. There exists a CET schedule that keeps th e vector of world prices constant, implying that the vector of net external purchases made by the CU as a whole is unchanged. This CET, combined with free trade among members of the CU, makes it possible for income transfers to be made among members such that, in each country, the consumption bundle in the CU is revealed preferred to that prior to the agreement. The full proof of this theorem is complex but may be understood intuitively in terms of the analysis of the gains from trade in Chapter 18. Fo rming a CU involves, for each country, a comparison of two tariff regimes: one with an initial set of tari ffs unique to each versus one in which a subset of countries share a CET.

The particular CET cho sen, however, keeps prices and trade volumes of each good constant for non-members, with two implications. First, the non-member nations are not harmed by the CU. Second, taking the CU as a whole there is no terms-of-trade effect. Equivalently, the aggregate amount of tariff revenues do not change when added up among all the CU members. The difficulty is that trade-tax revenues will rise in some member countries and fall in others with the shift to the CET, depending on initial tariff levels and the changes in import volumes. However, the analy sis in equation (18.13) covers this situation nicely. We repr oduce it here as equation (22.2), with superscript c for member i indicating the situation with the customs union in place and superscript r referring to the pre-agreement case.

In their case each country must reset its individual tariff schedule after entering an FTA so that its imports from, and exports to, non-member countries are unc hanged for each good. The FTA therefore has no impact on prices in the rest of the world, while within each country an expression like equation (22.1) holds.

It follows that each CU participant gains from the ag reement, while the rest of the world experiences no change in welfare. 4 Three additional important comments should be made. First, even though these transfers are feasible, they may not actually be made in practice. Nonetheless, economists are willing to claim that there is a welfare gain so long as such transfers are possible in principle. This is an example of the compensation principle widely used in welfare economics. Second, the Kemp-Wan criterion may be comp ared to the WTO principle permitting the forma tion of PTAs.

However, such agreements do not arise randomly among nations. Rather, they are the result of conscious choices made by governments. This observation raises the obvious question of which econom ic factors determine the endogenous decisions of countries to form CUs and FTAs. Put differently, which economic characteristics make it likely that a set of countries \u0152 or the world \u0152 would gain welfare as a result of forming a preferential trade agreement? Because FTAs embody numerous elements of second-best economics there are no fully definitive theoretical answers to this question.

The author calculated world welfare as these countries were combined into various configurations of equally sized FTAs, or trading blocs. Within these blocs countries have zer o tariffs but each sets its optimal tariffs against goods from non-members. Krugman\u2122s computations f ound that as the number of FTAs went down (and, therefore, countries joined ever-larger blocs), world welfare would decline and be minimized at three.

Only when the world reaches two blocs, so that the number of included and excluded goods are the same, can trade creation gains begin to outweigh trade diversion losses. Krugman\u2122s model was criticized on other important grounds and we mention two here. First, by assuming that all countries produce a single good with just labor, the model ignored the important possibility that countries could differ in factor e ndowments and the efficiency of producing goods with different factor intensities (Deardorff and Stern, 1994) . However, the ability of countries within an FTA to specialize resources and reduce costs according to comparative advantage is a critical potential source of welfare gains. Put differently, trade creation w ithin the FTA because of specialization should enhance welfare. Second, Krugman\u2122s model assumed there were no trade costs, either inside an FTA region or from countries outside the agreement.

Suppose, instead, that countries were located on three \ufb01continents\ufb02, with low intra-contin ental transport costs and high inter-continental transport costs, which would make welfare calculations very different. In the starkest case of zero local trade costs and infinite inter-continental costs, the emergence of an FTA on each continent would effectively mirror global free trade and maximize welfare. 5 Indeed, the presence of trade costs suggests that economic geography matters greatly for the selection of FTA partners, which is consistent with the re gional orientation of most trade agreements. In this regard, countries in close proximity to each other may be considered \ufb01natural\ufb02 partners (Frankel, Stein, and Wei, 1995). This kind of analysis suggests there are three major economic factors determining which countries might choose to form FTAs with each other.

Third, countries in close proximity should have lower transport costs and enjoy larger net FTA gains. A further observation is that what really matters is the scale of these factor s relative to those in the rest of the world. For example, in MERCOSUR there are variations in capital and labor abundance between Brazil and Uruguay, but these may be small compared to those between Brazil and the United States, tending to limit the intra-FTA specialization gains. These factors were studied closely in an impor tant paper by Baier and Bergstrand (2004). They [PAGE 398] 7 developed a simulation model that supports the fo llowing hypotheses.

In turn, countries with these char acteristics should be mo re likely to be FTA partners. The authors studied all possible FTA pairings of 54 countries in 1996 and found strong empirical support for each of these hypotheses. Thus, the probability th at two countries share an FTA is significantly more likely if they are closer together, jointly larger in size but close together in scale, and have markedly different capital-labor ratios.

The primary advantage to Mexico emerges from its relative labor abundance in the region, permitting more efficient production according to comparative advantage. 22.5 Empirical Evidence A primary question about FTAs and CUs is whether they create more trade among members than they divert away from non-memb ers. One common means of studyng this is to estimate a standard gravity model, as explained in Chapter 13, and ente r dummy variables that indicate whether two countries both belong to a particular FTA. This was the appr oach in Frankel, Stein and Wei (1995), who studied the impact of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) grouping of countries, the European Community (EC) and NAFTA on bilateral trade flows.

There are at least two significant problems with th at approach. First, as noted above, membership in a FTA is not exogenously given, but rather an endogenous policy choice. This means that FTAs are likely to include countries that already have unusually high trade among themselves, perhaps due to close geographical proximity or strong historical ties. Thus, the error terms would be correlated with the dummy variables and the OLS coefficients of member ship would be biased.

Properly assessing that factor is impossible with aggregate trade data, rather than detailed product information.

This is important for assessing the terms-of-trade effects of NAFTA. Romalis assembled data on around 4,000 product cat egories for the period 1980 to 2000, which covered years both before and after NAFTA was implemen ted in 1994.

First, there may be pro-competitive gains from breaking down monopolies. These gains can make the broader economy more efficient and expand production, with large impacts on welfare (Konan a nd Maskus, 2006). Second, larger markets generated by FTAs can raise domestic investment and attract inflows of capital, which can expand productivity (Kehoe, 2005). Third, market expansion also encourag es new firms to enter and existing firms to develop new products (Rutherford and Tarr,"

Third, market expansion also encourag es new firms to enter and existing firms to develop new products (Rutherford and Tarr, 2002). This expansion in the extensive margin of trade seems especially important in NAFTA (Kehoe, 2005). These issues are likely far more important than static trade creation and trade diversion in assessing the long- term impacts of trade agreements, a claim that needs much more research by economists.
