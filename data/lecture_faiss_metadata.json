WHY STUDY INTERNATIONAL TRADE? \u2022 Governments restrict movement of goods/services & factors of production \u2022 Restrictions strongest on labor (immigration) and capital (FDI) \u2022 Technology doesn\u2019t flow easily across borders: - Tied to human capital & institutions (legal systems, infrastructure) \u2022 Example: U.S. Constitution enables free intra-state commerce, unlike international trade \u2022 Trade is politically divisive: - Bipartisan disagreement (e.g., Trump & Biden both criticized NAFTA) - Skepticism among general public (Gallup poll on NAFTA) - Economists overwhelmingly support trade (IGM Chicago panel) III. WHAT IS GLOBALIZATION? Definition (Deardorff & Stern): 1. Increase in international market transactions (goods, services, factors) 2. Expansion of multinational corporations and global institutions (UN, IMF, WTO) \u2022 Globalization Metrics: - Trade flows (goods & services) - Foreign asset ownership - Immigration - Price convergence \u2022 Historical Trends: - 2 waves: late 1800s and post-WW2 - U.S. and Japan: relatively closed compared to other advanced economies IV. CONSEQUENCES OF GLOBALIZATION \u2022 Job market changes: - Manufacturing decline (see FRED data) - Shift to services - Rise in skill premium - Shrinking middle class (Pew data) - Routine jobs replaced by nonroutine jobs (Census Bureau) \u2022 Other Concerns: - Cultural", "lecture_id": "lecture_1", "chunk_id": 0}, {"text": "relatively closed compared to other advanced economies IV.

DRIVERS OF GLOBAL TRADE GROWTH 1. **Shipping Costs Decline**: - Container shipping (1956) - Air freight (IATA stats) - Short-run pandemic spikes 2. **Communication Advances**: - Lower phone/satellite/internet costs 3. **Trade Policy Liberalization**: - Tariff reductions across G20, developing nations 4. **Capital & Labor Mobility**: - FDI growth (UNCTAD) - Immigration trends (Census data) 5. **Price Convergence**: - Example: Grain price gaps (Chicago vs. Liverpool) \u2022 But note: U.S.\u2013China tariffs have risen recently (Trade War data) End of Lecture 1 Notes", "lecture_id": "lecture_1", "chunk_id": 1}, {"text": "Lecture 10: Production Functions INTRODUCTION TO MULTIPLE FACTORS \u2022 Adds capital (K) alongside labor (L) in production. \u2022 Some factors (e.g. labor) are more flexible than others across sectors or regions. \u2022 U.S. labor adjusts within ~6 years post-shock; capital adjusts over decades.

WHAT DOES THE WORLD ECONOMY LOOK LIKE? \u2022 World trade is dominated by: - Manufactured goods (~60%) - Services (~20%) - Mining (incl. fuels) and agriculture in some regions (see page 3-4) \u2022 Country Export Snapshots (2020): - **U.S.**: ICT, insurance/finance, soybeans, cars, petroleum - **France**: ICT, transport, wine, pharmaceuticals - **China**: ICT, electronics, toys, lamps - **Saudi Arabia**: Crude oil (53%+), refined oil, polymers - **Mali** (2013): Gold (74%), cotton, raw materials \u2022 Top U.S. Import Categories (2015): - Electrical machinery, oil, vehicles, computers, medical equipment \u2022 Top U.S. Export Categories (2016): - Machinery, aircraft, vehicles, plastics \u2014 mainly intra-industry trade \u2022 Top Traders: - Leading exporters (2015): China, U.S., Germany - Leading service traders: U.S., China, Germany (see page 17-18) \u2022 Trade Openness: - Hong Kong, Singapore: trade/GDP > 100% - U.S., Japan: much lower openness (~25-30%) II. WHO TRADES WITH WHOM? \u2022 Trade is influenced by: - Geography (distance) - Country size (GDP) - Cultural/language ties - Common borders, trade agreements, colonial history \u2022 **Gravity Equation** for Trade: Tij = A * (Yi)^a * (Yj)^b / (Dij)^c - Trade \u221d country size - Trade \u221d 1/distance - Coefficients a,", "lecture_id": "lecture_2", "chunk_id": 0}, {"text": "WITH WHOM? \u2022 Trade is influenced by: - Geography (distance) - Country size (GDP) - Cultural/language ties - Common borders, trade agreements, colonial history \u2022 **Gravity Equation** for Trade: Tij = A * (Yi)^a * (Yj)^b / (Dij)^c - Trade \u221d country size - Trade \u221d 1/distance - Coefficients a, b, c \u2248 1 in empirical studies \u2022 Even with tech and shipping improvements, distance still matters (pg. 24) \u2022 U.S. trades more with closer nations (e.g., Canada, Mexico) despite EU size III. GAINS FROM TRADE \u2022 Trade is **mutually beneficial**: - Consumers get cheaper/better imports - Exporting firms access new markets \u2022 But there are **losers**: - Domestic firms facing foreign competition - Workers in declining sectors - Even these groups benefit as consumers \u2022 Question: If internal trade is good, why should international trade be feared? \u2022 Differences across countries: - Technology, labor, capital, raw materials - Government institutions and human capital IV.

CONCERNS ABOUT TRADE \u2022 Labor Standards: - Workers' rights, working conditions, child labor \u2022 Market Failures: - Infant industries, monopolies, externalities (e.g., pollution) - Public/cultural goods - Trade restrictions might help, but are often misused VII.

TWO-GOOD MODEL: IMMIGRATION IN H-O SETUP \u2022 Goods: Clothing (capital-intensive), Food (labor-intensive). \u2022 Immigration mimics biased growth toward Food in a closed economy: 1. RS shifts \u2192 PF/PC falls 2. Stolper-Samuelson effect \u2192 w/r falls 3. Real wages fall, capital gains \u2022 In a small open economy: - PF/PC fixed \u2192 w/r fixed - Rybczynski effect: immigration affects output mix, not factor prices - Impact depends on trade openness EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE 1. Wage Convergence (1870\u20131913): - Higher wages in destination countries - Wages grew faster in origin countries - Chart on page 19 supports convergence via migration. 2. U.S. Immigration Trends: - Chart (p.21): foreign-born share dropped mid-century, rose post-1980. - Chart (p.22): shift from NW Europe to Latin America/Asia. - Skill distribution: U-shaped across education (Peri 2006, p.24).", "lecture_id": "lecture_23", "chunk_id": 1}, {"text": "destination countries - Wages grew faster in origin countries - Chart on page 19 supports convergence via migration. 2.

EXAMPLES \u2022 Boeing 787 components: built in U.S., Japan, Italy, France, Korea, etc. (diagram on p.6)\u3010247\u2020source\u3011. \u2022 Apple iPhone: designed in California, components from Korea, Japan, Germany, etc., assembled in Shenzhen, China (p.7)\u3010247\u2020source\u3011. THE ECONOMICS OF TASK TRADE \u2022 Offshoring increases when tasks are tradable and wages are lower abroad. \u2022 Autor, Levy, and Murnane: routine vs. non-routine tasks matter (p.12)\u3010247\u2020source\u3011. \u2022 Blinder: distinction between physically vs. electronically deliverable tasks. \u2022 Rising offshoring even in high-skill areas like programming and accounting. GROSSMAN & ROSSI-HANSBERG MODEL \u2022 Two types of tasks: L (low-skill) and H (high-skill). \u2022 Offshoring reduces the cost of L tasks if performed abroad. \u2022 Marginal task i offshored if a_L W = bt(i)a_L W* (p.23)\u3010247\u2020source\u3011. \u2022 The cost of a unit of apparel includes offshore and onshore components (p.24\u201325). TECHNICAL INSIGHT \u2022 Cost savings from offshoring mimic productivity gains (p.26\u201327). \u2022 Lower b \u2192 more tasks offshored (I\u2191) \u2192 wage effects through changes", "lecture_id": "lecture_24", "chunk_id": 0}, {"text": "\u2022 Marginal task i offshored if a_L W = bt(i)a_L W* (p.23)\u3010247\u2020source\u3011. \u2022 The cost of a unit of apparel includes offshore and onshore components (p.24\u201325).

WAGE EFFECTS \u2022 In small open economy: - Offshoring raises domestic wages of low-skill labor (w\u2191) because cost savings increase demand (p.29)\u3010247\u2020source\u3011. \u2022 In large open economy: - Relative-price and labor-supply effects may offset productivity gains: - Expansion of offshoring \u2192 fall in apparel prices \u2192 Stolper-Samuelson pressures on wages (p.32)\u3010247\u2020source\u3011. EVIDENCE & IMPLICATIONS \u2022 Increase in imported intermediate inputs and services (charts pp.9\u201310)\u3010247\u2020source\u3011. \u2022 Growing share of non-routine work among U.S. and German workers (pp.12\u201313). \u2022 Offshoring allows reallocation of labor to higher-value non-routine tasks. FINAL THOUGHTS \u2022 Offshoring \u2260 threat, but a form of technological change. \u2022 Winners: high-skill, non-routine task workers. \u2022 Losers: routine task workers displaced by competition abroad.
