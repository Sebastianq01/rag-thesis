      "text": "Real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 4.7 percent in the second quarter of 1996, following a 2.0 percent increase in the first quarter. Real GDP increased by $78.3 billion, after a $33.6 billion increase previously. The estimates are based on more complete source data than preliminary estimates, which had shown a 4.8 percent increase. The increase in real GDP was widespread across all major components except net exports and nonresidential structures. The largest increases were in personal consumption expenditures and government spending. The real change in business inventories added $10.1 billion to second-quarter real GDP growth, following a subtraction of $17.6 billion in the first quarter. Businesses increased inventories by $7.1 billion in the second quarter. Real gross domestic purchases increased 5.2 percent in the second quarter, compared with a 3.0 percent increase in the first quarter. This reflects strong domestic demand supporting GDP growth. Real gross national product increased 4.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with a 2.3 percent increase in the first quarter. GNP includes net factor income from abroad, while GDP excludes it. Current-dollar GDP increased 6.5 percent, or $118.3 billion, in the second quarter. In the first quarter, current-dollar GDP had increased 4.2 percent, or $76.2 billion. The final estimate of the second-quarter increase in real GDP is 0.1 percentage point lower than the preliminary estimate. The largest downward revision was to federal government spending, while net exports were revised upward."

Current-dollar GDP — the market value of the nation's output of goods and services — increased 8.2 percent, or $193.0 billion, in the second quarter to a level of $9,945.7 billion. In the first quarter, current-dollar GDP increased 8.3 percent, or $193.0 billion. The final estimate of the second-quarter increase in real GDP is 0.3 percentage point, or $7.4 billion, higher than the preliminary estimate issued last month. The upward revision to the percentage change in real GDP primarily reflected a downward revision to imports and an upward revision to exports."

In the second quarter, real GDP increased 5.6 percent. The GDP estimates released today are based on more complete source data than were available for the preliminary estimates issued last month. In the preliminary estimates, the increase in real GDP was 2.4 percent. The major contributors to the increase in real GDP in the third quarter were: Personal consumption expenditures (PCE), exports, and nonresidential fixed investment. The contributions of these components were partially offset by an increase in imports (which are subtracted in the calculation of GDP) and by decreases in federal government spending and in residential investment. The deceleration in real GDP in the third quarter primarily reflected downturns in inventory investment and in federal government spending and a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by an acceleration in PCE. The price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures prices paid by U.S. residents, increased 2.0 percent in the third quarter, 0.3 percentage point less than in the preliminary estimate; this index increased 2.1 percent in the second quarter. Excluding food and energy prices, the price index for gross domestic purchases increased 1.5 percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 1.7 percent in the second. Real personal consumption expenditures increased 4.5 percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 3.1 percent in the second. Real nonresidential fixed investment increased 7.7 percent, compared with an increase of 14.6 percent. Nonresidential structures increased 14.6 percent, compared with an increase of 4.4 percent. Equipment and software increased 5.6 percent, compared with an increase of 17.9 percent. Real residential fixed investment decreased 10.6 percent, in contrast to an increase of 1.3 percent. Real exports of goods and services increased 13.9 percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 14.3 percent in the second. Real imports of goods and services increased 17.0 percent, compared with an increase of 18.6 percent. Real federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment decreased 9.0 percent in the third quarter, in contrast to an increase of 17.2 percent in the second. National defense decreased 9.7 percent, in contrast to an increase of 16.9 percent. Nondefense decreased 7.9 percent, in contrast to an increase of 17.8 percent. Real state and local government consumption expenditures and gross investment increased 2.9 percent, in contrast to a decrease of 1.1 percent. The real change in private inventories subtracted 0.22 percentage point from the third-quarter change in real GDP, after adding 1.73 percentage points to the second-quarter change. Private businesses increased inventories $72.5 billion in the third quarter, following increases of $78.6 billion in the second quarter and $36.6 billion in the first. Real final sales of domestic product -- GDP less change in private inventories -- increased 2.4 percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 3.9 percent in the second. Real gross domestic purchases -- purchases by U.S. residents of goods and services wherever produced -- increased 3.0 percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 6.5 percent in the second. Real gross national product -- the goods and services produced by the labor and property supplied by U.S. residents -- increased 2.1 percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 5.6 percent in the second. GNP includes, and GDP excludes, net receipts of income from the rest of the world. Current-dollar GDP -- the market value of the nation's output of goods and services -- increased 3.8 percent, or $93.7 billion, in the third quarter to a level of $10,039.4 billion. In the second quarter, current-dollar GDP increased 8.2 percent, or $193.0 billion. The final estimate of the third-quarter increase in real GDP is 0.2 percentage point lower than the preliminary estimate issued last month. The major contributor to the downward revision was exports of goods and services, which contributed -0.15 percentage point. Within exports, a downward revision to exports of services more than offset an upward revision to exports of goods. Profits from current production (profits before tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments) increased $6.7 billion in the third quarter, according to revised estimates. In the second quarter, profits increased $27.3 billion. Current-production cash flow (net cash flow with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments) -- the internal funds available to corporations for investment -- increased $20.1 billion in the third quarter, compared with an increase of $35.3 billion in the second. Domestic profits of financial corporations increased $6.1 billion in the third quarter, in contrast to a decrease of $5.5 billion in the second. Domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations decreased $7.1 billion in the third quarter, in contrast to an increase of $27.3 billion in the second. In the third quarter, real gross corporate product increased, and profits per unit of real product decreased. The decrease in unit profits reflected a smaller increase in the prices nonfinancial corporations received than in the unit costs they incurred. The rest-of-the-world component of profits increased $7.8 billion in the third quarter, compared with an increase of $5.4 billion in the second. This measure is calculated as (1) receipts by U.S. residents of earnings from their foreign affiliates plus dividends received by U.S. residents from unaffiliated foreign corporations minus (2) payments by U.S. affiliates of earnings to their foreign parents plus dividends paid by U.S. corporations to unaffiliated foreign residents. The third-quarter increase was accounted for by a larger decrease in payments than in receipts. The revised estimate of third-quarter corporate profits from current production is $0.9 billion lower than the preliminary estimate issued last month. The foreign component of profits (rest-of-the-world profits) was revised up $2.7 billion. Domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations were revised down $5.3 billion, and domestic profits of financial corporations were revised up $1.7 billion. Profits before tax with inventory valuation adjustment is the best available measure of industry profits because estimates of the capital consumption adjustment by industry do not exist. According to this measure, domestic profits of financial corporations increased in the third quarter, and domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations decreased. The decrease in the profits of nonfinancial corporations reflected a large decrease in manufacturing and small decreases in the transportation and utilities group and in retail trade that were partly offset by increases in 'other' nonmanufacturing and in wholesale trade. Profits before tax increased $2.6 billion in the third quarter, compared with an increase of $21.8 billion in the second. The before-tax measure of profits does not reflect, as does profits from current production, the capital consumption and inventory valuation adjustments. These adjustments convert depreciation and inventory withdrawals reported on an historical-cost basis to the replacement-cost measures used in the national income and product accounts. The capital consumption adjustment decreased $5.0 billion in the third quarter (from $34.7 billion to $29.7 billion), compared with a decrease of $5.9 billion in the second. The inventory valuation adjustment increased $9.1 billion (from -$13.6 billion to -$4.5 billion), compared with an increase of $11.4 billion. Profits tax liability decreased $1.4 billion in the third quarter, in contrast to an increase of $5.7 billion in the second. Profits after tax increased $4.0 billion, compared with an increase of $16.0 billion. Dividends increased $7.1 billion, compared with an increase of $5.7 billion; undistributed profits decreased $3.0 billion, in contrast to an increase of $10.3 billion."

In the third quarter, real GDP increased 2.2 percent. The GDP estimates released today are based on more complete source data than were available for the preliminary estimates issued last month. In the preliminary estimates, the increase in real GDP was 1.1 percent. The major contributors to the increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter were personal consumption expenditures (PCE), government spending, and nonresidential structures. The contributions of these components were partially offset by decreases in exports, in private inventory investment, and in equipment and software investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased. The deceleration in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily reflected downturns in exports, in PCE for goods, and in nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by an upturn in federal government spending and a step-up in PCE for services. Imports turned down. The price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures prices paid by U.S. residents, increased 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter, 0.1 percentage point more than in the preliminary estimate; this index increased 2.0 percent in the third quarter. Excluding food and energy prices, the price index for gross domestic purchases increased 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 1.5 percent in the third. Real personal consumption expenditures increased 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 4.5 percent in the third.

In the third quarter, current-dollar GDP increased 3.8 percent, or $93.7 billion. The final estimate of the fourth-quarter increase in real GDP is 0.1 percentage point, or $0.5 billion, lower than the preliminary estimate issued last month. The downward revision to the percentage change in real GDP reflected downward revisions to private inventory investment and to exports of goods that were partly offset by an upward revision to exports of services. Profits from current production (profits before tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments) decreased $55.6 billion in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, profits increased $6.7 billion. Current-production cash flow (net cash flow with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments) -- the internal funds available to corporations for investment -- decreased $25.1 billion in the fourth quarter, in contrast to an increase of $20.1 billion in the third. The profits estimates reflect the effects of payments by tobacco companies related to out-of-court settlements, which reduced fourth-quarter profits by $14.2 billion and third-quarter profits by $6.2 billion. Domestic profits of financial corporations increased $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of $6.1 billion in the third. Domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations decreased $75.7 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with a decrease of $7.1 billion in the third. In the fourth quarter, both real gross corporate product and profits per unit of real product decreased. The decrease in unit profits reflected a smaller increase in the prices corporations received than in the unit costs they incurred; both unit labor and nonlabor costs increased. The rest-of-the-world component of profits increased $17.3 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of $7.8 billion in the third. This measure is calculated as (1) receipts by U.S. residents of earnings from their foreign affiliates plus dividends received by U.S. residents from unaffiliated foreign corporations minus (2) payments by U.S. affiliates of earnings to their foreign parents plus dividends paid by U.S. corporations to unaffiliated foreign residents.

Profits before tax with inventory valuation adjustment is the best available measure of industry profits because estimates of the capital consumption adjustment by industry do not exist. According to this measure, domestic profits of financial corporations increased, and domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations decreased. Profit decreases for nonfinancial corporations were widespread among major industry groups. The largest decreases occurred in durable goods manufacturing, in nondurable goods manufacturing, and in wholesale trade. Profits before tax decreased $51.0 billion in the fourth quarter, in contrast to an increase of $2.6 billion in the third. The before-tax measure of profits does not reflect, as does profits from current production, the capital consumption and inventory valuation adjustments. These adjustments convert depreciation and inventory withdrawals reported on an historical-cost basis to the replacement-cost measures used in the national income and product accounts.

In the second quarter, real GDP increased 0.3 percent. The GDP estimates released today are based on more complete source data than were available for the preliminary estimates issued last month. In the preliminary estimates, the decrease in real GDP was 1.1 percent. The major contributors to the decrease in real GDP in the third quarter were exports, nonresidential fixed investment, and private inventory investment. The negative contributions of these components were partly offset by positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and federal government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased sharply. The downturn in real GDP growth in the third quarter primarily reflected a deceleration in PCE, a downturn in state and local government spending, larger decreases in exports and in private inventory investment, and a deceleration in residential fixed investment that were partly offset by a smaller decrease in nonresidential fixed investment. There was also a much larger decrease in imports in the third quarter than in the second. The price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures prices paid by U.S. residents, decreased 0.1 percent in the third quarter, 0.1 percentage point less of a decrease than the preliminary estimate; this index increased 1.3 percent in the second quarter. Excluding food and energy prices, the price index for gross domestic purchases increased 0.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 0.9 percent in the second. The third-quarter downturn in the price index also reflected a deceleration in PCE services prices associated with the treatment of insurance payments resulting from the September 11th terrorist attacks. Real personal consumption expenditures increased 1.0 percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 2.5 percent in the second. Real nonresidential fixed investment decreased 8.5 percent, compared with a decrease of 14.6 percent. Nonresidential structures decreased 7.5 percent, compared with a decrease of 12.2 percent. Equipment and software decreased 8.8 percent, compared with a decrease of 15.4 percent. Real residential fixed investment increased 2.4 percent, compared with an increase of 5.9 percent.

National defense increased 3.2 percent, compared with an increase of 2.3 percent. Nondefense increased 4.2 percent, compared with an increase of 0.9 percent. Real state and local government consumption expenditures and gross investment decreased 1.3 percent, in contrast to an increase of 6.6 percent. The real change in private inventories subtracted 0.81 percentage point from the third-quarter change in real GDP, after subtracting 0.42 percentage point from the second-quarter change. Private businesses reduced inventories $61.9 billion in the third quarter, following decreases of $38.3 billion in the second quarter and $27.1 billion in the first. Real final sales of domestic product -- GDP less change in private inventories -- decreased 0.5 percent in the third quarter, in contrast to an increase of 0.7 percent in the second. Real gross domestic purchases -- purchases by U.S. residents of goods and services wherever produced -- decreased 1.0 percent in the third quarter, in contrast to an increase of 0.4 percent in the second. Real gross national product -- the goods and services produced by the labor and property supplied by U.S. residents -- decreased 1.3 percent in the third quarter, in contrast to an increase of 0.3 percent in the second. GNP includes, and GDP excludes, net receipts of income from the rest of the world. Current-dollar GDP -- the market value of the nation's output of goods and services -- increased 0.9 percent, or $22.3 billion, in the third quarter to a level of $10,224.9 billion. In the second quarter, current-dollar GDP increased 2.4 percent, or $60.9 billion. The final estimate of the third-quarter change in real GDP is 0.2 percentage point more of a decrease than the preliminary estimate issued last month. The downward revision to the change in real GDP primarily reflected downward revisions to state and local government spending, to exports of services, and to personal consumption expenditures for services. Profits from current production (profits before tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments) decreased $62.8 billion in the third quarter, according to revised estimates. In the second quarter, profits decreased $30.0 billion.

Domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations decreased $35.6 billion, compared with a decrease of $14.4 billion. Real gross corporate product and profits per unit of real product both decreased, reflecting smaller increases in prices received than in unit costs. The rest-of-the-world component of profits increased $2.1 billion, compared with an increase of $4.0 billion. Profits before tax decreased $57.7 billion in the third quarter, compared with a decrease of $17.4 billion in the second.

In the third quarter, real GDP decreased 1.3 percent. The GDP estimates released today are based on more complete source data than were available for the preliminary estimates issued last month. In the preliminary estimates, the increase in real GDP was 1.4 percent. The increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and from government spending that were partly offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment, from nonresidential fixed investment, from exports, and from residential investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased in the fourth quarter. The upturn in real GDP growth in the fourth quarter reflected accelerations in PCE and in government spending, and a smaller decrease in exports that were partly offset by larger decreases in inventory investment and in nonresidential fixed investment, and a downturn in residential investment. There was also a smaller decrease in imports in the fourth quarter. The price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures prices paid by U.S. residents, increased 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter, 0.1 percentage point more than in the preliminary estimate; this index decreased 0.1 percent in the third quarter. Excluding food and energy prices, the price index for gross domestic purchases increased 2.0 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 0.6 percent in the third. The fourth-quarter upturn in the price index reflected an acceleration in PCE services prices associated with insurance payments from the September 11th attacks. Real personal consumption expenditures increased 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 1.0 percent in the third. Real nonresidential fixed investment decreased 13.8 percent, compared with a decrease of 8.5 percent. Nonresidential structures decreased 33.6 percent, and equipment and software decreased 5.3 percent. Real residential fixed investment decreased 4.6 percent, in contrast to an increase of 2.4 percent. Real exports of goods and services decreased 10.9 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a decrease of 18.8 percent in the third.

Real state and local government consumption expenditures and gross investment increased 9.6 percent, in contrast to a decrease of 1.3 percent. The real change in private inventories subtracted 2.16 percentage points from the fourth-quarter change in real GDP. Private businesses reduced inventories $119.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Real final sales of domestic product increased 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter, in contrast to a decrease of 0.5 percent in the third. Real gross domestic purchases increased 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a decrease of 1.0 percent in the third. Real gross national product increased 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a decrease of 1.3 percent in the third. Current-dollar GDP increased 1.5 percent, or $38.4 billion, in the fourth quarter to a level of $10,263.3 billion. The final estimate of the fourth-quarter increase in real GDP is 0.3 percentage point higher than the preliminary estimate. Profits from current production increased $125.0 billion in the fourth quarter, following a decrease of $62.8 billion in the third. Current-production cash flow increased $78.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Domestic profits of financial corporations increased $46.9 billion, and domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations increased $57.2 billion. The rest-of-the-world component of profits increased $20.9 billion. Profits before tax decreased $61.2 billion, compared with a decrease of $57.7 billion in the third quarter. The large difference between profits before tax and profits from current production reflects large increases in the capital consumption adjustment, boosted by retroactive tax law changes under the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002. This legislation reduced profits before tax by $146.5 billion but did not affect profits from current production. Profits tax liability decreased $10.8 billion in the fourth quarter, and profits after tax decreased $50.4 billion. Dividends increased $8.3 billion. Corporate profits from current production decreased 12.5 percent for the full year 2001, after increasing 6.2 percent in 2000."

The increase in real GDP primarily reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE), exports, and nonresidential fixed investment, which were partly offset by negative contributions from federal government spending and residential fixed investment; meanwhile, imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, rose modestly. Notably, personal consumption expenditures grew at a robust 4.4 percent annual rate, marking the strongest pace since the first quarter of 2006, driven by solid increases in spending on both durable and nondurable goods as well as on services. Business investment also remained supportive of growth, as nonresidential fixed investment rose, particularly in the categories of equipment and intellectual property products, although investment in structures declined. In contrast, federal government spending declined sharply, led by a notable drop in national defense expenditures, while residential investment turned negative after several quarters of gains. On the trade side, exports expanded significantly but were partially offset by increased imports. Overall, final sales of domestic product, which exclude the effects of changes in private inventories, rose 2.3 percent. The price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures prices paid by U.S. residents, increased 1.1 percent, suggesting moderate inflation pressures. Corporate profits from current production increased $6.5 billion in the fourth quarter, a deceleration from the larger increases seen earlier in the year, reflecting modest growth in nonfinancial corporate profits and a slight decline in financial corporate profits."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States expanded at an annualized rate of 5.0 percent during the third quarter of 2014, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, representing an upward revision from the previously reported 3.9 percent increase and marking the strongest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter of 2003. This robust expansion reflected widespread strength across major components of output, with particularly notable contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE), nonresidential fixed investment, federal government spending, exports, residential investment, and state and local government expenditures, while imports, which act as a subtraction in the GDP calculation, declined modestly. The upward revision to GDP growth largely stemmed from stronger-than-expected gains in consumer spending and business investment, both of which were supported by improving labor market conditions, low inflation, and higher consumer and business confidence during the period. Personal consumption expenditures rose at a 3.2 percent pace, an acceleration from the second quarter's 2.5 percent gain, with durable goods purchases, especially in automobiles and household equipment, surging by 9.2 percent. Nonresidential fixed investment also posted a solid 8.9 percent gain, fueled by strong advances in equipment and intellectual property products, although investment in structures slowed. Residential fixed investment growth moderated to a 3.2 percent increase from an 8.8 percent rise previously. On the external side, real exports increased by 4.5 percent, although this represented a deceleration from the second quarter's rapid 11.1 percent gain, while real imports fell 0.9 percent, reversing the prior quarter's sharp increase, thereby contributing positively to net exports. Federal government expenditures rebounded sharply, rising 9.9 percent largely due to a 16.0 percent surge in defense spending following budget-related declines earlier in the year, while state and local government spending increased 1.1 percent. Private inventory investment made a negligible contribution to GDP growth, subtracting 0.03 percentage points, after having been a strong positive contributor the previous quarter. Final sales of domestic product, which exclude inventory changes, rose 5.0 percent, matching the headline GDP growth and underlining the strength of final demand. Inflation pressures remained muted, with the price index for gross domestic purchases increasing 1.4 percent, and core inflation, excluding food and energy, at 1.6 percent. Corporate profits from current production rose by $64.5 billion, reflecting gains across financial and nonfinancial corporations and a rebound in profits from the rest of the world. Real gross domestic income (GDI), an alternative measure of output based on incomes rather than expenditures, grew by 4.7 percent. Altogether, the third quarter of 2014 showcased a broadly based and powerful economic rebound, building momentum as the U.S. economy continued to recover from the sluggish start earlier in the year caused by adverse weather conditions."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States expanded at an annualized rate of 2.2 percent during the fourth quarter of 2014, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, maintaining the growth rate reported in the prior 'second' estimate, and representing a notable deceleration from the robust 5.0 percent growth recorded in the third quarter. The modest fourth-quarter expansion primarily reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE), nonresidential fixed investment, exports, state and local government spending, and residential fixed investment, which were partly offset by negative contributions from federal government spending and private inventory investment, while imports, which subtract from GDP calculations, rose sharply. The slowdown in GDP growth relative to the prior quarter was largely attributable to a significant upturn in imports, a downturn in federal government expenditures, a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment, and a more pronounced drag from private inventory accumulation, although these drags were partially mitigated by faster growth in PCE and improved spending by state and local governments. Consumer spending, which accounts for approximately two-thirds of GDP, accelerated strongly, rising at a 4.4 percent pace—the fastest since 2006—driven by broad-based gains across durable goods, nondurable goods, and services, reflecting solid gains in household incomes, lower energy prices, and improved consumer sentiment. Real nonresidential fixed investment increased by 4.7 percent, a slower pace compared to the third quarter’s 8.9 percent, as slower equipment investment largely offset strong growth in intellectual property products. Real residential fixed investment also picked up modestly, expanding by 3.8 percent, while real exports of goods and services maintained a healthy 4.5 percent growth rate. However, real imports surged by 10.4 percent, reversing the slight decline seen in the prior quarter, and thereby exerted considerable downward pressure on net exports. Federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment declined sharply by 7.3 percent, driven by a 12.2 percent plunge in national defense spending, following a strong increase in the third quarter. Meanwhile, state and local government spending increased 1.6 percent, contributing positively to growth. Inventory investment subtracted 0.10 percentage points from overall GDP growth, as businesses added $80.0 billion in inventories, slightly less than in preceding quarters. Inflation remained subdued, with the price index for gross domestic purchases decreasing by 0.1 percent, marking the first quarterly decline since 2009, as falling energy prices weighed on overall prices; core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose at a 0.7 percent pace. Real gross domestic income (GDI) grew by 3.1 percent, indicating somewhat stronger income-side growth compared to output-side measures. On an annual basis, real GDP rose by 2.4 percent in 2014, accelerating slightly from the 2.2 percent growth recorded in 2013, driven by improvements in private sector demand and an easing drag from fiscal consolidation at the federal level. Corporate profits from current production decreased $30.4 billion in the fourth quarter, a reversal from the $64.5 billion increase recorded in the third quarter, as domestic profits from financial corporations declined while profits from nonfinancial corporations increased modestly. The rest-of-the-world component of corporate profits, measuring foreign earnings of U.S. companies net of payments to foreign owners, declined sharply. Overall, despite the fourth-quarter moderation, the 2014 economic performance reflected a year of steady recovery and rebalancing, with strong private demand, subdued inflation, and robust labor market gains setting a foundation for continued growth into 2015."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States contracted at an annualized rate of 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2015, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, representing a modest improvement relative to the previously reported 0.7 percent decline but nevertheless marking a notable deceleration from the 2.2 percent expansion recorded in the final quarter of 2014. This decrease in real GDP primarily reflected negative contributions from exports, nonresidential fixed investment, and state and local government spending, which were only partially offset by positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE), private inventory investment, and residential fixed investment, while imports—subtracting from the calculation of GDP—increased sharply. The downturn in output growth largely stemmed from a deceleration in consumer spending, which nonetheless managed to post a 2.1 percent increase compared to the prior quarter's 4.4 percent surge, and from sharp contractions in exports and business investment in structures, exacerbated by a harsh winter, disruptions from port strikes, and a stronger dollar weighing on trade. The price index for gross domestic purchases fell by 1.6 percent, reflecting deflationary pressures largely due to falling energy prices; core inflation excluding food and energy increased a muted 0.1 percent. Within consumer spending, durable goods purchases rose 1.3 percent, a substantial slowdown from the 6.2 percent gain in the fourth quarter, while nondurable goods rose just 0.8 percent, and services spending grew by 2.7 percent. Real nonresidential fixed investment declined 2.0 percent overall, with an 18.8 percent collapse in nonresidential structures, driven by a sharp pullback in energy-related investment, partially offset by modest gains in equipment and intellectual property products. Real residential fixed investment provided a source of strength, increasing 6.5 percent compared to a 3.8 percent gain previously. Export volumes fell by 5.9 percent, a sharp reversal from the prior quarter’s expansion, while imports climbed 7.1 percent, reflecting stronger domestic demand relative to weaker foreign economies. Federal government spending was flat overall, with defense outlays falling by 1.2 percent while nondefense expenditures rose by 2.0 percent, and real state and local government spending declined 1.0 percent after growth in the previous quarter. Inventory accumulation contributed 0.45 percentage point to real GDP growth, as businesses added $99.5 billion to stocks, a modest increase from the prior quarter. Real final sales of domestic product—GDP excluding inventory changes—declined by 0.6 percent, emphasizing underlying demand weakness. In terms of income measures, real gross domestic income (GDI) rose 1.9 percent, suggesting some resilience in labor income and corporate earnings not fully captured by the expenditure-side GDP data. On a nominal basis, current-dollar GDP contracted by 0.2 percent, or $10.4 billion, to a level of $17,693.3 billion, reflecting the combination of weak real output and falling prices. Corporate profits from current production, which include adjustments for inventory valuation and capital consumption, decreased by $110.8 billion, a larger decline compared to the previous quarter’s $30.4 billion fall, reflecting declines in both nonfinancial and rest-of-world profits. The tax environment also shifted notably, as taxes on corporate income increased sharply by $25.3 billion, partly reflecting the expiration of bonus depreciation provisions, which simultaneously triggered a substantial $218.8 billion reduction in the capital consumption adjustment (CCAdj). Despite the contraction in GDP, the quarter reflected some stabilization in household consumption and housing investment, and the sharp inventory buildup suggests potential for stronger final demand growth in subsequent quarters."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP), representing the inflation-adjusted value of goods and services produced within the United States, advanced at an annualized rate of 3.9 percent in the second quarter of 2015, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, reflecting a meaningful acceleration relative to the modest 0.6 percent expansion recorded in the first quarter. This upward revision from the previous estimate of 3.7 percent growth was principally attributable to stronger-than-expected gains in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and nonresidential fixed investment, reinforcing the narrative of a broad-based economic rebound following the weather- and trade-related disruptions earlier in the year. The increase in real GDP during the second quarter primarily stemmed from sizable positive contributions from consumer spending, exports, nonresidential fixed investment, state and local government expenditures, and residential fixed investment, although this strength was partially tempered by an increase in imports, which exert a subtraction effect on GDP calculations. The acceleration in output growth was driven by a combination of factors, including a marked upturn in exports—following the contraction earlier in the year—an acceleration in household consumption spending, a slowdown in import growth relative to the first quarter, renewed strength in state and local government spending, and faster expansion in private business investment, especially in structures and intellectual property products. Meanwhile, real gross domestic income (GDI)—an alternative measure of economic output based on incomes rather than expenditures—rose 0.7 percent during the quarter, modestly higher than the 0.4 percent increase in the first quarter, and the average of real GDP and real GDI—a supplemental indicator intended to smooth discrepancies between the two measures—advanced 2.3 percent, highlighting that economic momentum was improving despite some residual softness in income growth. Real gross domestic purchases, which capture total U.S. purchases of goods and services including imports, rose by 3.6 percent, building upon a 2.5 percent increase in the prior quarter, and indicating robust domestic demand. On the price side, the gross domestic purchases price index rose 1.5 percent after falling by 1.6 percent in the first quarter, and core inflation excluding food and energy advanced by 1.2 percent, suggesting that underlying price pressures remained subdued but stable. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP expanded by 6.1 percent, or $264.4 billion, bringing the total output of the economy to $17,913.7 billion, a strong recovery from the 0.8 percent gain in the first quarter. Corporate profits rebounded sharply, increasing $70.4 billion after a substantial $123.0 billion decline in the first quarter, with gains observed across both financial and nonfinancial corporations as well as from earnings generated abroad. Taxes on corporate income rose by $31.3 billion, and after-tax corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments increased by $39.2 billion, following a steep decline previously. Dividends posted a modest $1.2 billion increase, while undistributed profits—an important gauge of retained earnings available for reinvestment—rose by $38.0 billion. Net cash flow, representing internal funds available to corporations for investment, climbed $48.1 billion, partially reversing earlier declines. Within the nonfinancial corporate sector, real gross value added contracted slightly, although profits per unit of real gross value added increased, benefiting from a favorable shift in unit prices and lower nonlabor costs that outweighed rising labor costs. Overall, the second quarter’s performance underscored a decisive return to solid economic growth, driven by resilient consumer demand, improved investment spending, and a rebound in external trade dynamics, even as certain sectors such as retail trade and nondurable goods manufacturing exhibited lingering weaknesses."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP)—representing the inflation-adjusted output of goods and services produced by the nation's economy after deducting the value of goods and services consumed in production—expanded at an annualized rate of 2.0 percent in the third quarter of 2015, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, thereby indicating a moderation from the robust 3.9 percent pace observed in the second quarter. Although this latest estimate marks a slight downward revision from the 2.1 percent growth reported in the 'second' estimate, the overall narrative of steady economic expansion remains largely intact, with the revision primarily reflecting a greater decline in private inventory investment than previously captured by earlier data. The growth in real GDP during the third quarter was principally supported by positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE), nonresidential fixed investment, state and local government spending, residential fixed investment, and exports, although these gains were partially offset by a marked negative contribution from private inventory investment, while imports—constituting a subtraction in the GDP calculation—increased during the period. The deceleration relative to the second quarter can be attributed primarily to a substantial downturn in private inventory investment coupled with slower growth across key categories including exports, consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment, and public sector spending at the state and local levels, though these were mitigated in part by a deceleration in the rate of import growth. Real gross domestic income (GDI)—an alternative measure of economic output based on incomes earned and costs incurred—rose by 2.7 percent, slightly stronger than its 2.2 percent increase in the prior quarter, and the average of real GDP and real GDI, which smooths discrepancies between the two measures, rose 2.3 percent, underscoring a moderate but broad-based expansion of economic activity. Real gross domestic purchases, which encompass all purchases by U.S. residents regardless of production origin, increased by 2.2 percent in the third quarter, easing from a 3.6 percent advance in the second quarter, while the price index for gross domestic purchases rose 1.3 percent, consistent with the previous quarter’s increase and suggesting stable but subdued inflationary pressures. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP climbed 3.3 percent, or $146.5 billion, to a level of $18,060.2 billion, decelerating from the prior quarter’s 6.1 percent surge, with softer growth reflecting reduced momentum in consumer and business spending. Corporate profits from current production, adjusted for inventory valuation and capital consumption (IVA and CCAdj), declined $33.0 billion in the third quarter, in contrast to the $70.4 billion gain seen in the second quarter, as weaker profits were recorded across both the domestic nonfinancial sector and the rest-of-the-world component, while profits of financial corporations showed only a modest increase. The decline in nonfinancial corporate profits was principally attributable to decreases in manufacturing—particularly durable goods such as motor vehicles and machinery—and in the utilities sector. Meanwhile, the rest-of-the-world component registered a $23.1 billion decline, driven by falling receipts from abroad and higher payments to foreign entities. Taxes on corporate income fell by $6.9 billion, leading to a $26.2 billion decline in after-tax corporate profits, while net cash flow with IVA, representing internal funds available for investment, fell by $35.1 billion, highlighting a reduction in retained earnings amidst a more challenging corporate earnings environment. Although real gross value added of nonfinancial corporations increased, profits per unit of value added declined, primarily due to rising unit labor costs, which more than offset the benefit from stable unit nonlabor costs and slight gains in unit prices. Overall, third-quarter data suggest that while domestic demand, particularly consumer spending, remained relatively resilient, the broader pace of economic growth moderated as businesses curtailed inventory accumulation and external headwinds weighed on trade-related components, setting the stage for more cautious momentum heading into the final quarter of the year."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP)—the inflation-adjusted measure of the nation's total output of goods and services, net of intermediate inputs—expanded at an annualized rate of 1.4 percent during the fourth quarter of 2015, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, reflecting a further upward revision from the previously reported 1.0 percent in the 'second' estimate, though still representing a noticeable deceleration from the 2.0 percent growth recorded in the preceding quarter. While the overall profile of economic activity remained broadly consistent with prior estimates, the upward revision primarily stemmed from stronger-than-previously-estimated personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and a slightly improved picture for exports, although this was partially counterbalanced by a downward revision to private inventory investment. The fourth-quarter growth was underpinned by positive contributions from PCE, residential fixed investment, and federal government spending, which were offset in part by declines in nonresidential fixed investment, exports, private inventory investment, and state and local government spending, while imports—which are deducted in GDP calculations—declined, providing a slight boost to measured growth. The deceleration in overall real GDP growth, compared to the third quarter, primarily reflected downturns in business investment and state and local government activity, alongside a slower pace of consumer spending and weaker export performance, although a smaller drag from inventories, a downturn in imports, and an acceleration in federal spending helped to partially mitigate the loss of momentum. Real gross domestic income (GDI), an alternative measure of economic output based on the sum of incomes earned and costs incurred during production, increased by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter, down from a 2.0 percent increase in the third, with the average of GDP and GDI—a supplemental gauge smoothing discrepancies between the two metrics—growing at a modest 1.1 percent pace. Real gross domestic purchases, which tracks expenditures by U.S. residents on goods and services produced both domestically and abroad, rose by 1.5 percent, slower than the 2.2 percent gain in the third quarter, suggesting a broader moderation in demand conditions. Inflationary pressures remained subdued, as the price index for gross domestic purchases increased by just 0.4 percent during the quarter, matching the second estimate and considerably lower than the 1.3 percent rise seen previously, while core inflation, excluding food and energy, registered a 1.0 percent increase. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP rose by 2.3 percent, or $104.6 billion, reaching a level of $18,164.8 billion, compared with a 3.3 percent gain in the third quarter, further highlighting the slowdown in nominal growth momentum toward the end of the year. Corporate profits from current production, adjusted for inventory valuation and capital consumption (IVA and CCAdj), posted a significant decline of $159.6 billion in the fourth quarter, markedly steeper than the $33.0 billion decrease recorded in the third, with broad-based weakness across both financial and nonfinancial domestic corporations, alongside further deterioration in profits from the rest of the world. Profits of domestic financial corporations fell by $24.0 billion, reversing a modest $1.8 billion gain in the third quarter, while nonfinancial corporate profits plummeted by $129.2 billion, compared with an $11.8 billion decline previously, largely driven by contractions in nondurable manufacturing, particularly in petroleum and coal products industries. Taxes on corporate income fell sharply, decreasing by $32.2 billion, further depressing after-tax profits, which declined by $127.4 billion. Notably, dividends paid out by corporations decreased by $15.1 billion, while undistributed profits—a key indicator of internal financing capacity—fell by $112.2 billion, and net cash flow with IVA, representing internal funds available for investment, declined by $101.6 billion. For the full calendar year 2015, real GDP rose by 2.4 percent, matching the rate of growth achieved in 2014, though underlying composition shifted: decelerations in nonresidential investment and export growth, combined with stronger import growth, were offset by more robust increases in consumer spending and residential investment, as well as a smaller decline in federal government spending. Meanwhile, the price index for gross domestic purchases advanced by a mere 0.4 percent for the year, markedly slower than the 1.5 percent recorded in 2014, underscoring the persistent softness in overall inflation. Current-dollar GDP grew by 3.5 percent, or $598.9 billion, to reach $17,947.0 billion by year-end 2015, a modest deceleration from the 4.1 percent gain observed in 2014. During the year, corporate profits from current production contracted by $64.0 billion, reversing the $35.6 billion increase registered in 2014, with declines concentrated in the nonfinancial sector and in the rest-of-the-world component, despite a modest annual increase in profits of financial corporations. Overall, the fourth-quarter and full-year data paint a picture of a U.S. economy that, while continuing to grow at a moderate pace, faced mounting headwinds from faltering business investment, weaker global demand, and still-muted inflationary pressures, factors that contributed to a soft landing in economic activity entering 2016."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP)—which measures the inflation-adjusted value of all goods and services produced by the nation's economy, less the value of intermediate inputs consumed—rose at an annualized rate of 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2016, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, representing an upward revision from the previously reported 0.8 percent growth in the 'second' estimate and building modestly upon the 1.4 percent expansion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. This updated figure incorporates more complete source data, particularly reflecting stronger export activity and firmer nonresidential fixed investment than initially reported, even as personal consumption expenditures (PCE) growth was revised downward slightly. Overall, the expansion in real GDP during the first quarter was driven by positive contributions from PCE, residential fixed investment, state and local government spending, and exports, which were partially offset by declines in nonresidential fixed investment, private inventory investment, and federal government spending; meanwhile, a decline in imports—which subtract from the GDP calculation—contributed positively to the headline figure. When compared to the previous quarter, the deceleration in GDP growth reflected a marked slowdown in the pace of consumer spending growth, a sharper contraction in business fixed investment, and a downturn in federal government expenditures, partially offset by upturns in exports and stronger residential investment. Meanwhile, real gross domestic income (GDI)—an alternative measure of economic activity based on income earned and costs incurred in production—rose a strong 2.9 percent, a notable acceleration from the 1.9 percent gain recorded in the fourth quarter, suggesting firmer momentum underlying the output-side figures; the average of real GDP and real GDI, often cited by economists as a more stable measure of true economic growth, increased by 2.0 percent. Real gross domestic purchases, reflecting spending by U.S. residents on all goods and services regardless of production origin, grew at a 0.9 percent pace, slowing from a 1.5 percent increase in the prior quarter. Inflation pressures remained muted, with the gross domestic purchases price index advancing only 0.2 percent, the same subdued pace as reported previously, while the core index excluding food and energy components rose by a somewhat firmer 1.4 percent. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP expanded by 1.4 percent—or $65.3 billion—reaching a level of $18,230.1 billion, a notable slowdown relative to the $104.6 billion gain recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Corporate profits from current production, after suffering a steep decline at the end of 2015, rebounded moderately, increasing $34.7 billion in the first quarter; this rebound masked divergent sectoral trends, as domestic nonfinancial corporations posted a $72.9 billion gain in profits while financial corporations saw a further $11.3 billion decline, and profits from the rest of the world fell by $26.9 billion, underscoring continued global headwinds. Taxes on corporate income rose $4.4 billion after a sharp drop in the fourth quarter, supporting a $30.3 billion increase in after-tax corporate profits. Dividends rose modestly by $8.2 billion, and undistributed profits increased by $22.1 billion, helping drive a $33.6 billion rise in net cash flow available for business investment. Adjustments for inventory valuation and capital consumption showed small net declines, indicating a stabilization in accounting factors that had introduced volatility in prior quarters. Overall, the first quarter of 2016 depicts a U.S. economy growing modestly on the surface but demonstrating stronger income growth beneath, despite persistent drags from sluggish business investment and external trade challenges."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP), representing the inflation-adjusted value of all goods and services produced within the United States minus the value of goods and services consumed in the production process, increased at an annualized rate of 1.4 percent during the second quarter of 2016, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, marking a modest upward revision from the 1.1 percent growth reported in the 'second' estimate and a notable acceleration relative to the 0.8 percent increase recorded in the first quarter. This latest estimate incorporates more comprehensive source data, most significantly reflecting that nonresidential fixed investment, previously estimated as declining, actually rose during the quarter, contributing to a somewhat firmer picture of economic activity. Growth in real GDP during the second quarter was underpinned by positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE), exports, and nonresidential fixed investment, although these gains were partially offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment, residential fixed investment, and state and local government spending; imports, which enter the GDP calculation as a subtraction, rose during the quarter and weighed modestly on overall growth. The improvement in the pace of GDP growth relative to the first quarter primarily stemmed from an acceleration in consumer spending, an upturn in nonresidential investment, and stronger export activity, despite a deeper decline in inventories, weaker residential investment, and increased imports. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP expanded by 3.7 percent, or $168.5 billion, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual level of $18,450.1 billion, compared to a 1.3 percent, or $58.8 billion, rise in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures picked up somewhat, as the price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures prices paid by U.S. residents, rose 2.1 percent following a modest 0.2 percent increase in the first quarter; within this, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index climbed 2.0 percent, while the core PCE index, excluding volatile food and energy components, rose 1.8 percent after a 2.1 percent increase in the prior period. Real gross domestic income (GDI), an alternative measure of economic activity based on incomes earned and costs incurred in production, fell by 0.2 percent in the second quarter, a sharp reversal from the 0.8 percent gain in the first quarter, and the average of real GDP and real GDI increased only 0.6 percent, suggesting a mixed underlying momentum. Corporate profits from current production, after posting a strong $66.0 billion increase in the first quarter, fell by $12.5 billion in the second quarter, driven primarily by a $56.1 billion contraction in the profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations, even as financial corporations saw a moderate $5.6 billion increase. Notably, the rest-of-the-world component of corporate profits surged by $38.0 billion, in contrast to a sharp decline in the first quarter, as receipts from abroad rose significantly while payments decreased marginally. Overall, the economic picture for the second quarter of 2016 indicates a moderate expansion, with consumer activity serving as the principal engine of growth amid soft investment and inventory dynamics, and with some rebound in international earnings amid still subdued domestic corporate profitability."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the inflation-adjusted value of goods and services produced by the nation's economy less the value of intermediate goods and services used up in production, expanded at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent during the third quarter of 2016, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This figure represents a further upward revision from the 'second' estimate of 3.2 percent and reflects stronger-than-previously-reported increases in nonresidential fixed investment, personal consumption expenditures (PCE), and state and local government spending. The robust pace of growth in the third quarter compares favorably to the 1.4 percent advance recorded in the preceding quarter, signaling a substantial strengthening in economic activity. Growth during the quarter was fueled by positive contributions from PCE, exports, private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, and federal government spending, while residential fixed investment exerted a modest drag; imports, which subtract from the calculation of GDP, also rose. The acceleration in real GDP from the second quarter primarily reflected an upturn in private inventory investment, an acceleration in exports, smaller declines in state and local government spending and residential investment, and an increase in federal government spending, though these gains were tempered by a smaller rise in PCE and an uptick in imports. Real gross domestic income (GDI) climbed by an even stronger 4.8 percent, following a 0.7 percent increase in the second quarter, and the average of real GDP and real GDI — a supplemental indicator designed to smooth disparities between the two — rose 4.1 percent. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP advanced by 5.0 percent, or $225.2 billion, reaching an annualized level of $18,675.3 billion, compared with a 3.7 percent, or $168.5 billion, increase in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the price index for gross domestic purchases, a measure of inflation faced by U.S. consumers and businesses, rose by 1.5 percent, slightly slower than the 2.1 percent increase recorded in the second quarter. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index also advanced by 1.5 percent, while the core PCE index, excluding food and energy, edged up by 1.7 percent, slightly below the 1.8 percent pace of the prior quarter. Corporate profits from current production, a key indicator of business health, surged by $117.8 billion in the third quarter, sharply reversing the $12.5 billion decline observed in the second quarter. Profits of domestic financial corporations jumped by $50.1 billion, building on a modest gain in the prior quarter, while profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations rebounded by $66.4 billion following a substantial contraction. The rest-of-the-world component of profits, which reflects the difference between receipts from and payments to foreign entities, increased modestly by $1.3 billion, following a much larger gain of $38.0 billion in the second quarter. Overall, the third quarter of 2016 depicted an economy gaining traction, driven largely by household spending, stronger business investment, and improved external trade performance, even as certain sectors such as residential investment remained weak."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the inflation-adjusted value of all goods and services produced by the nation's economy, expanded at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This represents an upward revision from the previous 'second' estimate of 1.9 percent and follows a 3.5 percent increase recorded in the third quarter. The fourth quarter growth was supported by positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE), private inventory investment, residential fixed investment, nonresidential fixed investment, and state and local government spending, although these gains were partly offset by declines in exports and federal government spending; imports, which subtract from GDP calculations, also increased. The deceleration in real GDP growth compared to the third quarter primarily reflected sharp downturns in exports and federal government spending, alongside a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment and an acceleration in imports, though these negative effects were mitigated somewhat by stronger private inventory investment, robust consumer spending, and a recovery in residential fixed investment and state and local government expenditures. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP rose by 4.2 percent, or $194.1 billion, reaching a level of $18,869.4 billion, following a 5.0 percent gain in the third quarter. Inflation pressures edged higher, as the price index for gross domestic purchases advanced 2.0 percent, up from a 1.5 percent increase in the preceding quarter; the PCE price index similarly rose 2.0 percent. Excluding food and energy, core PCE prices rose by 1.3 percent, compared to a 1.7 percent increase previously. Real gross domestic income (GDI) increased 1.0 percent, a notable slowdown from the robust 5.0 percent pace in the third quarter, and the average of real GDP and real GDI — a metric used to smooth short-term volatility — increased by 1.5 percent. Corporate profits from current production grew modestly, increasing by $11.2 billion in the fourth quarter, a sharp slowdown compared to the substantial $117.8 billion rise in the third quarter. Profits of domestic financial corporations increased by $26.5 billion, while profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations declined by $60.4 billion, a figure impacted by a $19.8 billion annualized settlement between a U.S. subsidiary of Volkswagen and U.S. authorities. Meanwhile, the rest-of-the-world component of corporate profits surged by $45.1 billion, reflecting higher receipts from abroad and lower payments to foreign entities. On an annual basis, real GDP expanded by 1.6 percent in 2016, marking a slowdown from the 2.6 percent growth recorded in 2015, as a result of weaker nonresidential fixed investment, slower inventory accumulation, and softer consumer spending, although federal government spending and exports showed relative strength. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP grew by 3.0 percent, or $532.5 billion, reaching a level of $18,569.1 billion for the year. Inflation, as measured by the price index for gross domestic purchases, rose by 1.0 percent in 2016, up from a modest 0.4 percent increase in 2015. Overall, while the economy maintained moderate momentum into the end of 2016, growth was notably uneven across sectors, with clear drags from business investment and net exports partially balanced by resilient consumer spending and a gradual firming in the housing market."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the nation's inflation-adjusted output of goods and services, expanded at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the first quarter of 2017, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This marks a slight upward revision from the 'second' estimate of 1.2 percent, yet represents a notable deceleration compared to the 2.1 percent growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improved first-quarter estimate primarily reflects stronger-than-previously-estimated growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and exports, which more than offset a slight downward revision to nonresidential fixed investment. Real gross domestic income (GDI), which offers a complementary measure of economic activity based on income rather than production, increased by 1.0 percent in the first quarter, reversing a 1.4 percent decline seen in the previous quarter. Consequently, the average of real GDP and real GDI, a supplemental gauge of U.S. economic performance that helps smooth fluctuations, rose 1.2 percent during the period. The components contributing to the GDP expansion included positive influences from nonresidential fixed investment, exports, PCE, and residential fixed investment, although these were partly offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment, federal government spending, and state and local government spending. Imports, which are treated as a subtraction in GDP calculations, increased during the quarter. The deceleration in GDP growth relative to the previous quarter largely reflected a downturn in private inventory accumulation, a slowdown in consumer spending, and a contraction in state and local government expenditures, partially counterbalanced by a resurgence in export activity, stronger business investment, and a moderation in the pace of import growth. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP grew by 3.4 percent, or $157.7 billion, reaching a level of $19,027.1 billion, following a 4.2 percent gain in the fourth quarter. Inflation pressures firmed somewhat, as the price index for gross domestic purchases rose 2.5 percent, up from 2.0 percent in the prior quarter, while the PCE price index similarly increased 2.4 percent. Excluding food and energy, core PCE prices advanced 2.0 percent, up from a 1.3 percent increase previously. Corporate profits from current production declined by $48.4 billion in the first quarter, a sharp reversal from the $11.2 billion increase observed in the fourth quarter. Profits of domestic financial corporations fell by $27.9 billion, contrasting with the previous quarter’s $26.5 billion rise, while profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations edged down $11.1 billion. The rest-of-the-world component of corporate profits also decreased by $9.4 billion, a reversal from a $45.1 billion gain in the prior quarter, driven by higher payments to foreign entities outpacing modest gains in receipts. Overall, while the first quarter demonstrated ongoing economic expansion, the pace remained subdued relative to late 2016, characterized by weaker inventory investment, softer government spending, and modest gains in private sector activity."

This marked an upward revision from the 'second' estimate of 3.0 percent and reflected a notable strengthening compared to the 1.2 percent growth recorded in the first quarter. The updated estimate incorporates more complete source data, with the upward revision primarily attributed to a larger-than-previously-estimated increase in private inventory investment. Real gross domestic income (GDI), a complementary measure based on income flows, rose 2.9 percent in the second quarter, slightly accelerating from a 2.7 percent gain in the first quarter. The average of real GDP and real GDI, which provides a balanced view of U.S. economic activity, increased 3.0 percent, reflecting robust underlying momentum. Positive contributors to GDP growth included personal consumption expenditures (PCE), nonresidential fixed investment, exports, federal government spending, and private inventory investment, although these gains were partially offset by declines in residential fixed investment and state and local government spending. Imports, which subtract from the calculation of GDP, also increased during the quarter. The acceleration in GDP growth relative to the first quarter was driven by a sharp rebound in private inventory accumulation, faster growth in consumer spending, a slowdown in the pace of imports, and increased federal government expenditures. These factors were tempered somewhat by a downturn in residential investment, a deceleration in export growth, and weaker state and local government spending. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP expanded by 4.1 percent, or $192.3 billion, reaching a level of $19,250.0 billion. Inflationary pressures moderated notably, with the price index for gross domestic purchases rising just 0.9 percent, down from a 2.6 percent increase in the first quarter. Similarly, the PCE price index rose only 0.3 percent, with core PCE (excluding food and energy) increasing by 0.9 percent. Corporate profits from current production increased modestly by $14.4 billion in the second quarter, following a decline of $46.2 billion in the previous quarter. Within this measure, profits of domestic financial corporations fell by $33.8 billion, continuing the trend from the prior quarter, while profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations surged by $59.1 billion. The rest-of-the-world component of corporate profits declined by $10.8 billion, reflecting an increase in payments to foreign entities that outpaced the gain in receipts from abroad. Overall, the second quarter of 2017 represented a meaningful rebound in U.S. economic growth, fueled by stronger consumer and business spending, despite soft inflation and mixed signals from the corporate sector."

This reading represents a slight downward revision from the 3.3 percent growth reported in the 'second' estimate but maintains the overall picture of solid economic expansion. It also reflects a modest acceleration from the 3.1 percent growth recorded during the second quarter. The updated data incorporates more complete source material, with the primary revision being a slightly lower-than-previously-estimated increase in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), partially offset by upward revisions to state and local government spending. Real gross domestic income (GDI) increased 2.0 percent in the third quarter, following a 2.3 percent rise in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the average of real GDP and real GDI, a supplemental metric offering a more balanced view of economic activity, expanded by 2.6 percent, slightly slower than the 2.7 percent increase observed in the second quarter. The growth in GDP during the third quarter was driven by strong contributions from PCE, private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, federal government spending, and state and local government spending. These positive factors were partly offset by a negative contribution from residential fixed investment. A notable aspect of the quarter's performance was that imports, which act as a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased, further boosting overall GDP growth. The slight acceleration in real GDP compared to the previous quarter was primarily the result of a rebound in private inventory investment and an improvement in state and local government spending, although these gains were tempered by slower growth in PCE, nonresidential investment, and exports. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP increased by 5.3 percent, or $250.6 billion, bringing the total level of U.S. output to $19,500.6 billion. This marks a significant gain relative to the $192.3 billion increase recorded in the second quarter. Price pressures showed signs of picking up: the price index for gross domestic purchases rose by 1.7 percent, following a more modest 0.9 percent gain in the previous quarter.

This figure reflects a notable upward revision from the 2.5 percent growth previously reported in the 'second' estimate, with the improvement primarily driven by stronger-than-anticipated gains in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and private inventory investment. The third quarter had seen real GDP grow by 3.2 percent, suggesting a modest deceleration in economic momentum by year-end, although the underlying fundamentals remained robust. Real gross domestic income (GDI), an alternative measure of economic output that captures income received and costs incurred in production, rose by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter, slowing from a 2.4 percent increase in the third. Consequently, the average of real GDP and GDI — a supplemental metric that mitigates the effects of temporary discrepancies between the two measures — increased by 1.9 percent, following a 2.8 percent gain in the prior quarter. The fourth-quarter expansion was fueled by solid contributions from PCE, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, residential fixed investment, and government spending at both the federal and state and local levels. These positive contributions were partly offset by a decrease in private inventory investment, while imports, which subtract from GDP, increased during the quarter. The observed deceleration in GDP growth relative to the third quarter primarily reflected a pronounced downturn in inventory accumulation, despite stronger performances across PCE, exports, and various categories of government spending. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP advanced at a 5.3 percent annual rate, corresponding to an increase of $253.5 billion, raising the total value of U.S. economic output to $19,754.1 billion. This pace matched the current-dollar growth rate recorded in the third quarter. Inflationary pressures also picked up, with the price index for gross domestic purchases rising 2.5 percent, compared to a 1.7 percent increase in the previous quarter. The PCE price index, an important gauge for Federal Reserve policy, rose by 2.7 percent, up from 1.5 percent, with core PCE (excluding food and energy) advancing 1.9 percent. Regarding corporate profits, total profits from current production, which adjust for inventory valuation and capital consumption, declined by $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, marking a sharp reversal from the $90.2 billion gain recorded in the third quarter. Profits of domestic financial corporations fell by $14.6 billion, after a prior $47.8 billion increase, whereas profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations grew by $19.4 billion, building on a $10.4 billion increase in the previous period. Profits from the rest of the world decreased by $5.9 billion, reflecting both increased receipts and even greater increases in payments abroad. For the full year 2017, real GDP grew by 2.3 percent, representing a solid acceleration from the 1.5 percent growth rate recorded in 2016. This improvement stemmed largely from stronger PCE, a recovery in nonresidential fixed investment, and higher exports, even as private inventory investment posed a modest drag. Nominal GDP rose 4.1 percent over the year, or $766.1 billion, substantially higher than the 2.8 percent increase observed in 2016. Inflation for gross domestic purchases rose 1.8 percent during 2017, compared with 1.0 percent in 2016, indicating a gradual firming of price pressures across the economy. Corporate profits over the full year advanced by $91.2 billion, a sharp contrast to the $44.0 billion decline experienced in 2016, with gains observed across financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations, and profits earned from abroad. It is also noteworthy that the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted at the end of the year, introduced several significant changes to business taxation. While these changes did not affect corporate profits for current production or measured GDI, they did affect net cash flow calculations for the fourth quarter of 2017, thereby influencing some measures of corporate internal funds available for investment."

This growth rate represents a slight downward revision from the 'second' estimate of 2.2 percent, largely driven by softer-than-expected results in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and private inventory investment. By comparison, real GDP had advanced 2.9 percent during the final quarter of 2017, indicating a moderate slowing of economic momentum entering 2018. Real gross domestic income (GDI), an alternative measure of economic activity that captures incomes earned and costs incurred in production, surged by 3.6 percent in the first quarter, a notable acceleration from the 1.0 percent gain observed in the fourth quarter. Consequently, the average of real GDP and real GDI — which is often viewed as a more reliable indicator of underlying economic trends — rose by 2.8 percent during the first quarter, compared to a 2.0 percent increase in the preceding quarter. The composition of GDP growth in the first quarter reflected positive contributions from nonresidential fixed investment, PCE, exports, and government spending at both the federal and state and local levels. However, these gains were partly offset by declines in residential fixed investment and private inventory accumulation. Imports, which subtract from GDP, increased but at a slower pace relative to previous periods, helping moderate the drag from net trade. The overall deceleration in GDP growth relative to the fourth quarter stemmed primarily from slower expansions in PCE, exports, and government spending, coupled with a downturn in residential fixed investment, although a smaller contraction in inventories and a stronger rebound in nonresidential fixed investment partially mitigated these effects. Nominal GDP, which measures the value of the nation's output at current prices, rose by 4.2 percent, or $206.0 billion, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual level of $19.96 trillion by the end of the quarter. This represents a slight slowing from the 5.3 percent increase registered in the fourth quarter of 2017. Price pressures picked up somewhat during the period, as the price index for gross domestic purchases increased by 2.7 percent, compared to a 2.5 percent gain in the previous quarter. The PCE price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, rose by 2.5 percent, down slightly from 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter, while core PCE (excluding volatile food and energy components) rose by 2.3 percent, an uptick from 1.9 percent previously. Corporate profitability strengthened in early 2018, with profits from current production (which adjust for inventory valuation and capital consumption) climbing by $39.5 billion in the first quarter, reversing a slight decline of $1.1 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Within the corporate sector, profits of domestic financial corporations increased by $7.0 billion, following a previous decline of $14.6 billion, while profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations rose by $28.8 billion, improving upon the $19.4 billion increase seen in the previous period. Profits earned from international operations also posted gains, with rest-of-the-world profits advancing by $3.7 billion as receipts from abroad increased by $20.9 billion and payments to foreign entities rose by $17.2 billion. Looking ahead, it is worth noting that the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is preparing for the release of the 15th comprehensive, or benchmark, update of the national income and product accounts (NIPAs), which will be incorporated into the upcoming 'advance' estimate of second-quarter 2018 GDP to be published on July 27, 2018. This major revision will affect historical data and provide an updated framework for measuring economic activity moving forward."

This strong growth performance marks a notable acceleration from the 2.2 percent pace registered in the first quarter. The third estimate left the headline GDP growth rate unchanged from the second estimate, with revisions to underlying components generally offsetting each other; a downward revision to private inventory investment was balanced by upward adjustments to consumer spending (PCE), nonresidential fixed investment, exports, residential fixed investment, and government spending at both federal and state and local levels. Import growth was also revised downward, which slightly boosted the net export contribution. Real gross domestic income (GDI) rose 1.6 percent during the quarter, slowing from a 3.9 percent gain in the first quarter, resulting in an average of real GDP and GDI increasing by 2.9 percent. The composition of economic growth in Q2 reflected strong positive contributions from PCE, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, and government expenditures, which were partially offset by negative contributions from declines in private inventories and residential fixed investment. A notable positive development was that imports, which are subtracted in GDP calculations, decreased after having risen in the prior quarter. The acceleration in real GDP growth relative to Q1 was driven largely by faster gains in consumer spending, a surge in exports (particularly in anticipation of new tariffs), stronger federal government spending, and a smaller drag from residential investment. These positive forces were partially tempered by a sharper drawdown in business inventories and a slight slowing in nonresidential fixed investment growth. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP surged by 7.6 percent, or $370.9 billion, to a seasonally adjusted annual level of $20.41 trillion, reflecting the strongest quarterly gain in several years. Inflation measures showed signs of stabilization: the price index for gross domestic purchases rose 2.4 percent, slightly down from 2.5 percent in the first quarter. The PCE price index increased 2.0 percent, while the core PCE price index (excluding food and energy) advanced by 2.1 percent. Corporate profits strengthened meaningfully during the second quarter, with profits from current production (adjusted for inventory valuation and capital consumption) climbing by $65.0 billion, following a gain of $26.7 billion in the first quarter. Within the corporate sector, profits of domestic financial corporations rebounded by $16.5 billion, reversing a decline of $9.3 billion in the previous period. Profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations advanced by $53.0 billion, a strong pickup compared to the $32.3 billion increase recorded in Q1. However, the profits attributable to the rest of the world declined by $4.5 billion, as receipts from abroad rose modestly by $0.5 billion but were more than offset by a $5.0 billion increase in payments to foreign entities. Overall, the second quarter of 2018 reflected a substantial acceleration in U.S. economic activity, buoyed by robust domestic demand, rising investment, and a temporary surge in exports, providing momentum heading into the second half of the year."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of economic activity in the United States, expanded at an annualized rate of 3.4 percent in the third quarter of 2018, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This marked a modest slowing from the robust 4.2 percent growth rate recorded in the second quarter. The latest estimate incorporates more complete source data than were available for the second estimate, and while there were minor revisions—specifically, downward adjustments to personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and exports, offset by an upward revision to private inventory investment—the overall characterization of solid economic momentum remained intact. Real gross domestic income (GDI) rose sharply by 4.3 percent in the third quarter, a notable acceleration compared to the 0.9 percent increase in the second quarter. As a result, the average of real GDP and real GDI, a supplementary gauge that smooths volatility between the two series, increased by 3.8 percent. The growth in GDP during the third quarter was driven by positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures, private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, and both federal and state and local government spending. These gains were partially offset by negative contributions from exports and residential fixed investment. Imports, which act as a drag on GDP calculations, rose during the quarter after having declined in the second quarter. The deceleration in GDP relative to the second quarter primarily reflected a downturn in export activity—following a surge in Q2 related to trade front-loading ahead of tariffs—as well as slower growth in consumer spending and nonresidential fixed investment. However, a pickup in private inventory accumulation partially counteracted these headwinds. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP expanded at a 4.9 percent annual rate, translating to a $246.3 billion increase, bringing the total size of the U.S. economy to approximately $20.66 trillion. This represented a slower pace compared to the 7.6 percent surge seen in the second quarter. Inflation pressures, as measured by key price indices, remained moderate: the price index for gross domestic purchases rose 1.8 percent, slightly down from a 2.4 percent increase in the prior quarter. Meanwhile, the PCE price index rose 1.6 percent, and core PCE (excluding food and energy) also increased 1.6 percent, signaling contained inflation consistent with Federal Reserve targets. Corporate profitability continued to strengthen: profits from current production (adjusted for inventory valuation and capital consumption) rose by $78.2 billion during the third quarter, compared to a $65.0 billion increase in the second quarter. Profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations accounted for the majority of the gain, increasing by $83.0 billion. Meanwhile, profits of domestic financial corporations declined modestly by $6.1 billion, and rest-of-the-world profits advanced by $1.3 billion, as lower receipts from abroad were more than offset by an even larger reduction in payments to foreign entities. Overall, the third quarter of 2018 reflected continued solid economic performance, although there were emerging signs of slowing in some sectors, particularly in trade and consumer spending, as the economy adjusted to earlier fiscal stimulus and evolving global trade dynamics."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the total inflation-adjusted output of goods and services produced by the nation's economy, rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This marked a noticeable slowdown from the 3.4 percent expansion observed in the third quarter. The updated GDP figure incorporated more comprehensive source data than were available for the initial estimate; although private inventory investment, personal consumption expenditures (PCE), and state and local government spending were revised downward, these revisions were partially offset by a slight downward adjustment to imports, which act as a subtraction in the GDP calculation. Real gross domestic income (GDI) expanded by 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter, following a stronger 4.6 percent increase in the previous quarter, and the average of real GDP and GDI, which serves as a supplementary indicator of economic activity, advanced by 1.9 percent. The fourth quarter's economic growth reflected positive contributions from PCE, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, private inventory investment, and federal government spending, although these gains were tempered by negative contributions from residential fixed investment and state and local government spending. Imports also increased, weighing modestly on the net export balance. The deceleration in GDP growth compared to the third quarter primarily resulted from a slowdown in PCE, federal government spending, and private inventory investment, along with a downturn in state and local government expenditures. However, stronger export activity and a pickup in nonresidential fixed investment provided partial offsets. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP rose by 4.1 percent, or $206.9 billion, in the fourth quarter to a level of approximately $20.87 trillion, following a 4.9 percent, or $246.3 billion, increase in the third quarter. Inflation metrics remained moderate: the price index for gross domestic purchases increased 1.7 percent, just slightly lower than the 1.8 percent increase recorded in the third quarter. The PCE price index rose 1.5 percent, while core PCE, excluding food and energy, climbed 1.8 percent. Revisions to the fourth-quarter GDP primarily reflected downward adjustments to PCE, nonresidential fixed investment, and state and local government spending. These were partially mitigated by a downward revision to imports. For the full calendar year 2018, real GDP expanded by 2.9 percent, compared to a 2.2 percent increase in 2017, marking one of the strongest annual performances of the post-recession period. The yearly acceleration was driven by robust gains in PCE, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, federal government spending, private inventory investment, and state and local government spending, while residential fixed investment was a slight drag. Current-dollar GDP grew by 5.2 percent in 2018, equivalent to an increase of $1.01 trillion, bringing the economy to a size of approximately $20.49 trillion. Inflation remained contained for the year, with the price index for gross domestic purchases rising 2.2 percent, while the PCE price index increased 2.0 percent, and core PCE rose 1.9 percent. Measured from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018, real GDP rose by 3.0 percent, an improvement over the 2.5 percent increase recorded during 2017. On the corporate side, profits from current production, which adjust for inventory valuation and capital consumption, fell by $9.7 billion in the fourth quarter, contrasting sharply with the $78.2 billion increase observed in the third quarter. Profits of domestic financial corporations declined by $25.2 billion, while profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations rose by $13.6 billion. Meanwhile, rest-of-the-world profits increased by $1.9 billion, as international receipts outpaced payments. Overall, the fourth quarter of 2018 illustrated a slowing but still resilient economy, characterized by strong labor markets, moderate inflation, and robust consumer spending, even as the effects of fiscal stimulus began to fade and global uncertainties weighed on trade and investment."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP), representing the inflation-adjusted market value of goods and services produced within the United States, expanded at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter of 2019, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This rate of growth marked a notable acceleration from the 2.2 percent increase observed in the fourth quarter of 2018. The third estimate incorporated more complete source data relative to earlier estimates; while upward revisions to nonresidential fixed investment, exports, state and local government spending, and residential fixed investment were noted, these were offset by downward revisions to personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and private inventory investment as well as an upward revision to imports, which act as a subtraction in the GDP calculation. Real gross domestic income (GDI), a complementary measure of national output based on income earned and costs incurred in production, rose by 1.0 percent during the first quarter, following a 0.5 percent increase in the previous quarter. The average of real GDP and real GDI, a supplemental gauge of U.S. economic activity that equally weights both measures, increased by 2.1 percent in the first quarter compared to 1.3 percent growth in the fourth quarter. Growth in the first quarter of 2019 was driven by positive contributions from exports, personal consumption expenditures, nonresidential fixed investment, private inventory investment, and state and local government spending, although a modest negative contribution from residential fixed investment was observed. A key support to growth was the decline in imports, which added to net exports. Compared to the fourth quarter, the acceleration in real GDP reflected stronger contributions from state and local government spending, an upturn in private inventory investment, and a notable pickup in exports, although this was partially tempered by a deceleration in consumer spending (PCE). Current-dollar GDP increased by 3.8 percent, or $195.0 billion, reaching a level of approximately $21.06 trillion. In contrast, the fourth quarter of 2018 had seen a slightly higher nominal growth rate of 4.1 percent. Inflation pressures remained relatively muted: the price index for gross domestic purchases increased just 0.8 percent during the first quarter, compared to a 1.7 percent rise in the prior quarter. The PCE price index, a key measure closely monitored by policymakers, rose a modest 0.5 percent, down from a 1.5 percent increase in the fourth quarter; core PCE (excluding food and energy) rose by 1.2 percent, compared to 1.8 percent previously. Revisions to the GDP figures indicated that gains in investment and exports were largely offset by weaker-than-expected consumer spending and inventories, along with an increase in imports. On the corporate front, profits from current production — a measure that includes inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments — fell by $59.3 billion in the first quarter, marking a sharper decline compared to the $9.7 billion decrease recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. Profits of domestic financial corporations rose modestly by $1.4 billion, reversing a $25.2 billion drop in the fourth quarter. However, profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations fell sharply by $68.1 billion, while profits from the rest of the world increased by $7.4 billion, reflecting stronger foreign earnings relative to payments. Overall, the first quarter of 2019 demonstrated that while headline GDP growth remained solidly positive, underlying domestic demand showed signs of softening, driven by weaker consumer spending, softer business investment, and subdued inflation dynamics, all occurring against a backdrop of global economic uncertainties."

This marked a moderation from the 3.1 percent growth recorded in the first quarter. The updated estimate incorporated more comprehensive source data, which indicated that downward revisions to personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and nonresidential fixed investment were largely counterbalanced by upward revisions to state and local government spending, exports, and a downward revision to imports, which add to net GDP. Real gross domestic income (GDI), an alternative measure of economic activity based on income generated from production, rose by 1.8 percent in the second quarter, following a 3.2 percent increase in the first quarter. The average of real GDP and real GDI, often used as a supplemental indicator of overall economic momentum, grew by 1.9 percent in the second quarter compared to 3.2 percent previously. The second-quarter expansion was driven by positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures, federal government spending, and state and local government expenditures. These factors were partially offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment, exports, nonresidential fixed investment, and residential fixed investment. In particular, the deceleration in real GDP relative to the first quarter primarily reflected declines in private inventory investment, weakening exports, and a pullback in nonresidential fixed investment, although these were partially mitigated by stronger consumer spending and an acceleration in federal government outlays. Nominal GDP, which captures the market value of goods and services unadjusted for inflation, rose by 4.7 percent, or $241.5 billion, reaching $21.34 trillion. This represented an acceleration from the $201.0 billion nominal increase recorded in the first quarter. Inflation pressures picked up modestly: the price index for gross domestic purchases rose 2.2 percent, compared to just 0.8 percent in the first quarter. The PCE price index, a key inflation gauge for monetary policymakers, increased 2.4 percent, up sharply from 0.4 percent in the prior quarter, while the core PCE price index (excluding food and energy) rose 1.9 percent after a 1.1 percent gain. Corporate profits from current production, adjusted for inventory valuation and capital consumption, rebounded strongly in the second quarter, increasing by $75.8 billion after falling $78.7 billion in the first quarter. Profits of domestic financial corporations edged up by $2.5 billion, following a $22.2 billion increase previously, while profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations rose by $34.7 billion, reversing a $108.2 billion decline. Additionally, profits from the rest of the world climbed by $38.7 billion, supported by a $25.3 billion gain in receipts from abroad and a $13.4 billion decline in payments to foreign entities. Overall, despite the headline slowdown from the prior quarter, the second quarter of 2019 demonstrated that the U.S. economy continued to expand at a healthy pace, supported by robust consumer activity and government spending, even as signs of slowing business investment and global trade frictions began to emerge."

This represented a modest pickup from the 2.0 percent growth recorded in the second quarter. The updated estimate incorporated more complete source data and showed that upward revisions to personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and nonresidential fixed investment were fully offset by a downward revision to private inventory investment, leaving the overall GDP growth rate unchanged from the second estimate. Real gross domestic income (GDI), which captures income earned in the production of goods and services, also grew by 2.1 percent in the third quarter, accelerating from a 0.9 percent gain in the second quarter. The average of real GDP and real GDI, a supplemental indicator of economic momentum, similarly rose by 2.1 percent, reflecting a steady and broad-based economic expansion. The growth in real GDP was primarily driven by positive contributions from PCE, federal government spending, residential fixed investment, exports, and state and local government spending. These were partly offset by negative contributions from nonresidential fixed investment and private inventory investment. Imports, which subtract from GDP, increased during the quarter. The slight acceleration in economic activity relative to the previous quarter was supported by smaller declines in private inventories and upturns in exports and residential investment, though partly tempered by slower growth in consumer spending and government expenditures, along with a larger contraction in business investment. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP rose by 3.8 percent, or $202.3 billion, reaching a level of $21.54 trillion. This growth was somewhat slower than the 4.7 percent increase posted in the second quarter. Inflation indicators remained muted: the price index for gross domestic purchases increased 1.4 percent, down from a 2.2 percent rise in the prior quarter. Meanwhile, the PCE price index rose 1.5 percent, compared to a 2.4 percent increase previously, and the core PCE index (excluding food and energy) posted a stable 2.1 percent increase. Corporate profits presented a more cautious picture: profits from current production, adjusted for inventory valuation and capital consumption, decreased by $4.7 billion, contrasting sharply with a $75.8 billion increase in the second quarter. Profits of domestic financial corporations fell by $4.7 billion, while profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations decreased by $5.5 billion. In contrast, profits from the rest of the world rose by $5.5 billion, as payments to foreign entities declined more sharply than receipts. Overall, the third quarter of 2019 reflected a continuation of moderate but steady U.S. economic growth, with consumer spending, housing, and government spending supporting output amid weakening business investment and global trade headwinds."

Despite minor revisions, the overall picture of the economy remained stable; an upward revision to personal consumption expenditures (PCE) was largely offset by downward revisions to federal government spending and nonresidential fixed investment. The expansion in real GDP reflected positive contributions from PCE, exports, residential fixed investment, federal government spending, and state and local government spending, while private inventory investment and nonresidential fixed investment made negative contributions. Imports, which subtract from GDP, decreased during the quarter, providing a modest boost to growth. The economy exhibited a balanced but decelerating momentum: a downturn in private inventory investment and slower growth in PCE tempered the beneficial effects of stronger government and residential investment. Real gross domestic income (GDI), an alternative measure of output based on incomes earned, increased 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter, a notable pickup from the 1.2 percent increase in the third. The average of real GDP and real GDI, a supplemental indicator of economic performance, rose 2.4 percent, reinforcing the narrative of moderate but steady expansion. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP rose by 3.5 percent, or $186.6 billion, bringing the economy’s size to $21.73 trillion. Inflation remained subdued: the price index for gross domestic purchases rose 1.4 percent, identical to the prior quarter. The PCE price index also advanced 1.4 percent, while the core PCE index, excluding food and energy, rose 1.3 percent. Corporate profitability rebounded somewhat: corporate profits from current production, adjusted for inventory valuation and capital consumption, increased by $53.0 billion in the fourth quarter, reversing a $4.7 billion decline in the third quarter. Profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations led the rebound, rising by $53.7 billion, while financial corporations saw a modest increase of $0.7 billion. In contrast, rest-of-the-world profits fell by $1.4 billion. Over the full year 2019, real GDP expanded by 2.3 percent, a deceleration compared to the 2.9 percent growth recorded in 2018. This slowdown reflected reduced momentum in nonresidential fixed investment, exports, and PCE, partly offset by stronger government spending. Current-dollar GDP rose by 4.1 percent, or $847.5 billion, while the price index for gross domestic purchases advanced 1.5 percent. Corporate profits for the year were essentially flat, following a $68.7 billion gain in 2018, as softer domestic nonfinancial corporate profits offset gains elsewhere. Overall, 2019 closed with the U.S. economy in a phase of moderate but resilient growth, though with growing headwinds evident across business investment and external trade."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) contracted at an annualized rate of 5.0 percent in the first quarter of 2020, marking a sharp reversal from the 2.1 percent growth recorded in the final quarter of 2019, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The abrupt decline was largely driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which precipitated widespread economic disruptions beginning in March. In response to escalating public health risks, governments across the country issued 'stay-at-home' orders, prompting an unprecedented and immediate contraction in economic activity. These developments led to rapid shifts in consumption patterns, a collapse in service sector activity, supply chain disruptions, and mass layoffs, all of which severely curtailed economic output. While the full economic effects of the pandemic could not be isolated within the data, the broad-based downturn was evident across major GDP components. The contraction in real GDP reflected significant negative contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE), private inventory investment, exports, and nonresidential fixed investment. These declines were only partially offset by positive contributions from residential fixed investment, federal government spending, and state and local government spending. Imports, which subtract from GDP, also fell, softening the overall decline. The decrease in PCE was led by services, particularly in healthcare and food services and accommodations, as consumer demand shifted dramatically. Private inventory investment plummeted, especially in manufacturing sectors like petroleum and coal products, while exports of services, notably travel, contracted sharply. Nonresidential fixed investment also weakened significantly, dragged down by declines in transportation equipment. Real gross domestic income (GDI), which measures income earned in the production of goods and services, fell by 4.4 percent, underscoring the severe hit to business incomes and worker compensation. The average of real GDP and real GDI, a supplemental indicator of economic health, declined by 4.7 percent. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP decreased by 3.4 percent, or $189.4 billion, to a level of $21.54 trillion. Inflation remained relatively contained during the quarter, with the price index for gross domestic purchases rising 1.7 percent, slightly above the 1.4 percent recorded in the fourth quarter. The PCE price index increased 1.3 percent, while the core PCE index, excluding food and energy, rose 1.7 percent. Corporate profits from current production experienced a historic collapse, plunging by $262.8 billion following a $53.0 billion gain in the previous quarter. Profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations accounted for the bulk of this decline, decreasing by $181.8 billion, while financial corporations' profits fell by $37.5 billion. Profits from the rest of the world also contracted sharply, declining by $43.5 billion. The broad downturn in corporate earnings highlighted the profound economic stress brought on by the pandemic’s early stages. Overall, the first quarter of 2020 marked the beginning of a historic and unprecedented contraction in U.S. economic activity, setting the stage for an even steeper collapse in the second quarter as the full brunt of COVID-19 shutdowns took hold."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) collapsed at an annualized rate of 31.4 percent in the second quarter of 2020, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This unprecedented contraction followed a 5.0 percent decline in the first quarter, underscoring the historic economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The second-quarter data incorporated more complete source material than earlier estimates, with revisions showing a slightly smaller decline than the 31.7 percent drop previously reported. The economic downturn was driven by widespread shutdowns initiated in response to COVID-19, as 'stay-at-home' orders issued in March and April curtailed business operations, consumer activity, and supply chains, only partially offset by government stimulus payments distributed later in the quarter. The collapse in GDP reflected sharp declines across nearly all major components: personal consumption expenditures (PCE) plunged, led by services such as healthcare and discretionary spending categories like clothing and footwear; exports collapsed, particularly in capital goods; nonresidential fixed investment declined, driven heavily by transportation equipment; private inventory investment weakened, especially among motor vehicle dealers; and both residential investment and state and local government spending contracted. Only federal government spending, buoyed by COVID-related fiscal measures, provided a modest positive contribution. Imports, which subtract from GDP, also fell sharply, cushioning the decline somewhat. Current-dollar GDP declined by 32.8 percent, or $2.04 trillion, bringing the overall level to $19.52 trillion. Inflation pressures abated significantly, with the price index for gross domestic purchases falling 1.4 percent. The PCE price index declined 1.6 percent, reflecting widespread disinflationary pressures, while core PCE (excluding food and energy) declined 0.8 percent. Real gross domestic income (GDI) contracted even more severely than GDP, falling 33.5 percent, and the average of real GDP and real GDI fell 32.5 percent, underscoring the breadth of the economic collapse. Corporate profits from current production fell by $208.9 billion, following a $276.2 billion loss in the first quarter. Nonfinancial corporations posted a decline of $145.9 billion, while rest-of-the-world profits tumbled by $89.5 billion, highlighting the global scale of the pandemic’s impact. One bright spot was financial corporations, which saw profits rise by $26.5 billion, buoyed by strong securities trading and Federal Reserve interventions. The industry breakdown further illustrated the depth of the downturn: private goods-producing industries shrank 34.4 percent, services-producing industries contracted 33.1 percent, and government output declined 16.6 percent. Notably, 20 of 22 major industry groups contributed to the fall. Durable goods manufacturing, especially motor vehicles and parts, led the decline among goods-producing industries, while accommodation and food services, healthcare, air transportation, arts and entertainment, and professional services experienced the steepest contractions among service industries. Only finance and insurance posted gains, reflecting resilience in banking and securities. Real gross output—a broader measure of economic activity that captures total sales across industries—plummeted by 29.5 percent. Overall, the second quarter of 2020 stands as the sharpest quarterly contraction on record for the U.S. economy, a stark reflection of the sudden and profound disruption triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) rebounded at a record annualized rate of 33.4 percent in the third quarter of 2020, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This historic surge followed a catastrophic 31.4 percent collapse in the second quarter, reflecting the reopening of businesses and a partial resumption of economic activity as COVID-19 restrictions eased across much of the United States. The third estimate incorporated more complete source data, resulting in an upward revision from the second estimate's 33.1 percent growth. The substantial increase in GDP reflected strong rebounds in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), private inventory investment, exports, nonresidential fixed investment, and residential fixed investment. These gains were partly offset by declines in federal government spending—primarily related to reduced Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan administration fees—and in state and local government spending. Imports, which are subtracted from GDP calculations, increased sharply, tempering the headline growth figure. The surge in PCE was broad-based, with significant increases in both goods (especially motor vehicles, clothing, and footwear) and services (led by healthcare and food services). Private inventory investment, especially among motor vehicle dealers, surged as businesses restocked depleted inventories. Exports also rebounded, led by automotive vehicles and capital goods, signaling a partial recovery in global trade. Nonresidential fixed investment grew robustly, driven by equipment investment, particularly transportation equipment. Residential fixed investment climbed, buoyed by a surge in brokers' commissions and other ownership transfer costs amid a red-hot housing market. Current-dollar GDP soared 38.3 percent at an annual rate, adding $1.65 trillion to reach a level of $21.17 trillion. In contrast to the massive contraction in the second quarter, nominal activity expanded across nearly every sector. Inflation pressures returned: the price index for gross domestic purchases rose 3.3 percent, and the PCE price index increased 3.7 percent, after notable declines in the previous quarter. Core PCE, excluding food and energy, rose 3.4 percent, reflecting a sharp rebound in underlying inflation trends. Real gross domestic income (GDI) surged 25.8 percent in the third quarter, after a staggering 32.6 percent decline in the second, reflecting improvements in corporate earnings, wages, and other income streams. The average of real GDP and real GDI rose 29.6 percent. Corporate profits from current production rebounded dramatically, rising by $499.6 billion, recovering sharply from the $208.9 billion loss in the second quarter. Profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations soared by $436.2 billion, while rest-of-the-world profits rose by $51.3 billion, underscoring the partial normalization of global supply chains and financial markets. Industry-level data further confirmed the breadth of the recovery: private goods-producing industries expanded by 47.2 percent, led by durable goods manufacturing, especially motor vehicles and parts. Private services-producing industries grew 35.1 percent, powered by healthcare and social assistance, accommodation and food services, retail trade, and wholesale trade. Government output rose 10.1 percent, reflecting increased activity in both federal and state/local levels. Gross output, measuring total sales or receipts across industries, climbed 28.7 percent, with 19 of 22 industry groups contributing to the expansion. Notably, mining, federal government, and utilities experienced output declines, even amid the broader economic recovery. Overall, the third quarter of 2020 marked the sharpest quarterly GDP expansion on record, highlighting the resilience of the U.S. economy following an unprecedented pandemic-induced collapse, though the level of economic activity remained below pre-pandemic peaks."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an annualized rate of 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This marked a substantial deceleration from the record 33.4 percent surge in the third quarter, as the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic-induced recession moderated amid renewed outbreaks and reimposed restrictions. The third estimate reflected more complete source data, notably upward revisions to private inventory investment, partially offset by downward revisions to nonresidential fixed investment and personal consumption expenditures (PCE). The fourth quarter’s growth was driven by strong contributions from exports, nonresidential fixed investment, personal consumption, residential fixed investment, and inventory restocking. However, these gains were tempered by declines in both state and local government spending and federal government spending, the latter reflecting a reduction in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan administrative activity. Imports, which subtract from GDP, rose sharply, partially offsetting domestic output gains. The increase in exports was concentrated in goods, especially industrial supplies and materials. Nonresidential fixed investment rebounded, led by equipment spending, particularly in transportation equipment. PCE growth was anchored by rising services spending, led by healthcare. Housing activity continued to climb, with residential fixed investment expanding notably in single-family construction. Private inventory investment turned positive, reflecting rebuilding across durable and nondurable manufacturing sectors. Current-dollar GDP rose by 6.3 percent ($324.4 billion) in the fourth quarter to reach $21.49 trillion. Inflation remained contained: the price index for gross domestic purchases rose 1.7 percent, and the PCE price index increased 1.5 percent. Core PCE (excluding food and energy) rose 1.3 percent, significantly cooling from the 3.4 percent increase recorded in the third quarter. Real gross domestic income (GDI) increased 15.7 percent in the fourth quarter, a significant slowdown from the 24.1 percent growth in Q3, reflecting moderating wage, profit, and tax flows. The average of real GDP and real GDI, a broader measure of economic activity, grew 9.9 percent. Corporate profits from current production fell by $31.4 billion in the fourth quarter, ending the previous quarter’s $499.6 billion rebound. Profits of domestic financial corporations rose by $17.5 billion, while domestic nonfinancial corporation profits declined by $48.2 billion, indicating a more uneven sectoral recovery. Rest-of-the-world profits fell modestly by $0.7 billion. Industry-level data revealed broad-based but uneven growth: private goods-producing industries rose 6.1 percent, led by construction and durable goods manufacturing (notably computers and fabricated metals). Private services-producing industries grew 4.9 percent, driven by finance and insurance, health care and social assistance, professional services, and administrative support, although educational services and accommodation and food services posted declines. Government output fell by 1.1 percent, reflecting reductions at both the federal and state/local levels. Real gross output—a measure of industry sales activity—expanded 6.7 percent in the fourth quarter, led by durable goods manufacturing and services industries such as health care and professional services. For the full year 2020, the economy contracted 3.5 percent, the sharpest annual decline since 1946. This downturn reflected massive declines in personal consumption (especially services), exports, nonresidential fixed investment, and state and local government activity, only partially offset by increases in federal spending and residential investment. Measured from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020, real GDP fell 2.4 percent. Current-dollar GDP fell 2.3 percent ($496.6 billion) over the year to $20.94 trillion. Inflation remained subdued in 2020, with the gross domestic purchases price index rising just 1.2 percent. Corporate profits for the year fell $130.2 billion, with domestic financial and nonfinancial profits declining and rest-of-the-world profits contracting sharply by $74.0 billion. Real GDP by industry confirmed the magnitude of the COVID-19 shock: private goods-producing industries fell 2.7 percent, private services-producing industries declined 3.9 percent, and government output decreased 2.1 percent. The deepest contractions were recorded in accommodation and food services, arts and entertainment, transportation, and health care, while sectors such as finance, insurance, and information technology exhibited resilience. Despite the sharp Q3 and Q4 rebounds, overall output remained below its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2020, setting the stage for a fragile and uneven recovery entering 2021."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an annual rate of 6.4 percent in the first quarter of 2021, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This strong growth followed a 4.3 percent gain in the fourth quarter of 2020, highlighting the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The third estimate incorporated more complete source data, and while upward revisions were made to nonresidential fixed investment, private inventory investment, and exports, these were offset by a stronger increase in imports, which subtract from GDP. The first-quarter growth was fueled by robust gains in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), nonresidential fixed investment, federal government spending, residential investment, and state and local government spending. However, private inventory investment and exports posted declines, while imports rose sharply, reflecting strong domestic demand. The PCE surge was broad-based, with significant increases in durable goods (notably motor vehicles and parts), nondurable goods (led by food and beverages), and services (primarily food services and accommodations). Nonresidential fixed investment was buoyed by solid gains in equipment spending, particularly information processing equipment, and continued strength in intellectual property products, driven by software. Federal government spending rose, supported by payments to banks for Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan administration and purchases of COVID-19 vaccines for mass distribution. The decline in inventory investment was primarily due to reduced retail inventories, particularly among motor vehicle dealers, while exports fell slightly. COVID-19 relief measures continued to influence economic activity: government transfer payments to households and businesses under the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act and the American Rescue Plan Act stimulated spending and helped support growth. Current-dollar GDP surged 11.0 percent in the first quarter, or $566.8 billion, reaching a level of $22.06 trillion. Inflation accelerated notably, with the price index for gross domestic purchases rising 4.0 percent, compared to 1.7 percent in the previous quarter. The PCE price index jumped 3.7 percent, while core PCE (excluding food and energy) increased 2.5 percent, underscoring emerging inflationary pressures. Real gross domestic income (GDI) also posted a strong gain, rising 7.6 percent following a 19.4 percent surge in the fourth quarter, reflecting improvements in business earnings and compensation flows. The average of real GDP and real GDI, a more comprehensive measure of economic activity, advanced 7.0 percent. Corporate profits rebounded, increasing $55.2 billion after a $31.4 billion decline in the fourth quarter. Domestic nonfinancial corporate profits rose sharply by $72.1 billion, while financial corporate profits dipped by $6.4 billion. Profits from the rest of the world fell $10.6 billion. Sectoral industry data indicated broad gains: private goods-producing industries expanded 5.4 percent, supported mainly by durable goods manufacturing, led by computers, fabricated metals, and machinery. Private services-producing industries posted a robust 7.7 percent gain, driven by strong performances in professional services, information services (especially data processing and internet publishing), administrative and waste management services, real estate, and retail trade. However, declines were observed in other services (e.g., activities of political organizations) and healthcare services. Government activity increased modestly by 0.2 percent, reflecting gains in both federal and state and local sectors. Real gross output—a broader measure of industry sales and receipts—rose 8.9 percent, driven largely by private services, notably retail trade, finance and insurance, and information sectors. Goods-producing industries' gross output declined 1.7 percent, with notable weakness in nondurable goods manufacturing, specifically petroleum and coal products. Overall, 17 of 22 industry groups contributed positively to gross output growth. The results from the first quarter positioned the U.S. economy strongly for further recovery in 2021, bolstered by vaccine rollouts, sustained fiscal stimulus, and pent-up consumer demand."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an annualized rate of 6.7 percent in the second quarter of 2021, according to the 'third' estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This followed a 6.3 percent increase in the first quarter, reflecting the sustained recovery of the U.S. economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The 'third' estimate incorporated more complete source data, and while upward revisions were made to personal consumption expenditures (PCE), exports, and private inventory investment, these were partly offset by an upward revision to imports, which subtract from GDP. Growth in the second quarter was underpinned by a robust rebound in consumer spending, strong business investment, a surge in exports, and solid contributions from state and local government spending. However, private inventory investment and residential fixed investment weakened, while federal government spending declined notably due to a reduction in Paycheck Protection Program-related expenditures. COVID-19-related impacts persisted, but the reopening of establishments and increased vaccine rollout underpinned stronger activity. The PCE increase was broad, led by services (especially food services and accommodations) and goods (notably pharmaceuticals, clothing, and footwear). Nonresidential fixed investment rose strongly, driven by transportation equipment and intellectual property products, such as software and research and development activities. Export growth was led by nonautomotive capital goods and a rebound in travel services. Residential investment declined slightly, and private inventories, notably in retail trade (particularly motor vehicle dealers), dragged on growth. Import volumes rose sharply, consistent with strong domestic demand. Nominal GDP surged 13.4 percent at an annualized rate, or $702.8 billion, reaching $22.74 trillion. Inflation pressures intensified: the price index for gross domestic purchases rose 5.8 percent, while the PCE price index accelerated to 6.5 percent. Core PCE (excluding food and energy) rose 6.1 percent, signaling persistent underlying inflation. Real gross domestic income (GDI) rose more modestly, increasing 2.3 percent, compared to 6.3 percent in the first quarter, and the average of real GDP and real GDI rose 4.5 percent. Corporate profits strengthened significantly, increasing by $267.8 billion after a $123.9 billion gain in the first quarter. Profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations soared by $221.3 billion, while financial corporations recorded a $52.8 billion increase. Profits from the rest of the world declined modestly by $6.2 billion. Sectoral industry data showed widespread contributions to growth: private goods-producing industries expanded 4.7 percent, driven by gains in nondurable goods manufacturing (especially petroleum and coal products), construction, and durable goods manufacturing (especially other transportation equipment). Private services-producing industries surged 7.8 percent, led by rebounds in accommodation and food services, professional services, real estate, information technology, and healthcare services. However, retail trade contracted, mainly due to motor vehicle and parts dealer sales. Government output rose 3.4 percent, reflecting a recovery in state and local government activities. Gross output across industries rose 5.5 percent overall, with a 9.5 percent surge in private services-producing industries, partially offset by a 2.5 percent decline in goods-producing sectors and a 1.6 percent decline in government output. The second quarter reflected a robust period of recovery momentum, although challenges such as global supply chain disruptions and emerging COVID-19 variants were starting to cast uncertainty over the second half of 2021."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annualized rate of 2.3 percent in the third quarter of 2021, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This marked a significant slowdown from the second quarter’s 6.7 percent growth rate, as the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, driven by the Delta variant, disrupted economic reopening plans across the United States. The third estimate included more complete source data and reflected upward revisions to personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and private inventory investment, partially offset by downward revisions to exports. Real GDP expansion was supported primarily by gains in private inventory investment, PCE (especially in services), state and local government spending, and nonresidential fixed investment. However, contractions in residential fixed investment, federal government spending, and a decline in exports weighed on overall growth. Imports, which subtract from GDP, increased, though slightly less than initially reported. The gains in private inventory investment were driven largely by a rebuilding of wholesale and retail trade inventories, particularly in motor vehicles and parts dealers. Consumer spending on services—such as international travel and transportation services—rebounded strongly, while goods consumption declined, led by falling motor vehicle sales amid semiconductor shortages. State and local government spending rose, notably due to increased compensation in education sectors. Nonresidential fixed investment advanced modestly, driven by growth in intellectual property products (mainly software and R&D), though declines in equipment and structures investment offset some of this strength. The downturn in residential investment reflected reduced construction of single-family homes and fewer improvements. Federal government spending declined, reflecting a sharp drop in nondefense spending as Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) administrative processing wound down. Export activity also weakened amid global logistical challenges, with declines in both goods and services exports. Nominal (current-dollar) GDP grew 8.4 percent, adding $461.3 billion to reach a level of $23.20 trillion. Inflation remained elevated: the price index for gross domestic purchases rose 5.6 percent, while the PCE price index grew by 5.3 percent. Core PCE (excluding food and energy) rose 4.6 percent, underscoring persistent inflationary pressures. Real gross domestic income (GDI) grew faster than GDP, increasing 5.8 percent, suggesting some divergence between income-based and expenditure-based measures. The average of real GDP and GDI rose 4.1 percent. Corporate profits from current production rose by $96.9 billion in the third quarter, slowing from the $267.8 billion surge in the second quarter. Domestic financial corporation profits rose $14.2 billion, while domestic nonfinancial corporations gained $31.6 billion. Rest-of-the-world profits rebounded sharply by $51.1 billion, reversing a prior quarter decline. Industry breakdowns revealed mixed results: private services-producing industries rose 3.9 percent, government expanded by 5.1 percent, but private goods-producing industries contracted by 5.5 percent, largely driven by declines in construction. Within services, notable growth occurred in professional, scientific, and technical services; finance and insurance; and accommodation and food services. However, retail trade declined, especially motor vehicles and parts sales. Real gross output, a measure of industry-wide sales, rose 4.4 percent, led by a 7.6 percent increase in services, while goods-producing sectors contracted by 2.5 percent. Government gross output edged up only 0.3 percent. Overall, the third quarter of 2021 demonstrated the economy’s resilience amid Delta variant headwinds, supply chain disruptions, and the gradual withdrawal of federal pandemic relief support, setting the stage for stronger momentum into the year-end."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an annualized rate of 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This represented a strong acceleration from the 2.3 percent growth seen in the third quarter, driven primarily by a substantial increase in private inventory investment. The third estimate reflected slightly lower growth than the second estimate (7.0 percent), with downward revisions to personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and exports, partly offset by an upward revision to inventory investment. The gain in private inventories was concentrated in the retail sector, notably among motor vehicle dealers, as businesses rebuilt stockpiles depleted during earlier pandemic disruptions. Other contributors to the growth included increases in PCE (especially in services like healthcare and recreation), exports (led by widespread growth in goods and a rebound in travel services), and nonresidential fixed investment (centered on intellectual property products such as software and R&D). These gains were partly offset by declines in federal government spending, mainly in defense procurement, and state and local government investment, particularly in educational structures. Imports rose, subtracting from GDP. COVID-19 continued to influence the economy in the fourth quarter, as the Omicron variant drove new restrictions and operational disruptions, although the effects were embedded in the source data rather than explicitly quantified. Current-dollar GDP surged by 14.5 percent annualized, an increase of $800.5 billion, reaching a level of $24.00 trillion. Inflationary pressures remained significant, with the price index for gross domestic purchases increasing 7.0 percent. The PCE price index rose 6.4 percent, and core PCE (excluding food and energy) rose 5.0 percent. Real gross domestic income (GDI) increased by 5.1 percent in the quarter, while the average of real GDP and GDI rose by 6.0 percent, indicating a balanced strength across income and expenditure measures. Corporate profits from current production rose modestly by $20.4 billion, slowing sharply compared to previous quarters. Domestic financial corporation profits edged down slightly, while nonfinancial corporation profits increased marginally. Profits from the rest of the world rebounded, gaining $16.8 billion. Industry performance was broad-based: private goods-producing industries grew by 5.4 percent, services-producing industries surged by 8.5 percent, and government activity edged up by 0.1 percent. Within goods-producing sectors, durable and nondurable goods manufacturing led the gains, particularly in chemicals and motor vehicles. Services growth was fueled by expansions in information services, professional and scientific sectors, real estate activities, and wholesale trade, while utilities output declined. Gross output across the economy rose by 3.8 percent, with 15 of 22 industry groups contributing. For the full year 2021, real GDP grew by 5.7 percent, the strongest annual gain since 1984, rebounding from the pandemic-driven contraction of 3.4 percent in 2020. The surge reflected strong contributions from PCE, nonresidential investment, exports, residential investment, and private inventory rebuilding. Price pressures also surged over the year, with the gross domestic purchases price index rising 3.9 percent and the PCE price index up 3.9 percent as well. Corporate profits soared by $562.0 billion over the year, contrasting sharply with the decline seen in 2020, driven by strong gains in both financial and nonfinancial domestic sectors. Industry-wise, private services-producing industries were the leading contributors to annual growth, expanding by 6.6 percent, while goods-producing industries rose by 5.1 percent, and government output increased by 1.5 percent. The U.S. economy closed 2021 with strong momentum, although ongoing pandemic risks, rising inflation, and supply chain constraints remained significant challenges heading into 2022."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) declined at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the first quarter of 2022, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This marked a significant reversal from the 6.9 percent expansion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. The third estimate revised GDP downward slightly from the second estimate of -1.5 percent, reflecting a downward revision to personal consumption expenditures (PCE) that was only partially offset by an upward revision to private inventory investment. The contraction in GDP was driven by decreases in exports, federal government spending, private inventory investment, and state and local government spending, while imports—counted as a subtraction in GDP—rose sharply. In contrast, PCE, nonresidential fixed investment, and residential fixed investment posted increases. COVID-19 disruptions, particularly related to the Omicron variant, continued to weigh on economic activity, though their impacts were embedded in source data and not separately quantified. The drop in exports reflected widespread declines in nondurable goods. Federal government spending fell due to reductions in defense procurement. Inventory drawdowns were concentrated in wholesale trade, notably among motor vehicle dealers, and in the utilities sector. On the positive side, increases in business investment in equipment and intellectual property, as well as services spending by households—particularly on housing, utilities, and miscellaneous services—helped partially cushion the decline. However, goods spending declined, with notable weakness in groceries and gasoline purchases. Current-dollar GDP rose 6.6 percent, or $383.9 billion, to a level of $24.39 trillion. Inflation remained elevated: the price index for gross domestic purchases rose 8.0 percent, while the PCE price index increased 7.1 percent; core PCE (excluding food and energy) rose 5.2 percent. Disposable personal income fell by 1.3 percent in nominal terms, while real disposable income dropped 7.8 percent, highlighting the impact of inflation on household purchasing power. The personal saving rate declined sharply to 5.6 percent from 7.9 percent in the prior quarter. On the income side, real gross domestic income (GDI) grew by 1.8 percent, significantly outpacing GDP, while the average of GDP and GDI—a broader measure of economic activity—ticked up just 0.1 percent. Corporate profits fell by $63.8 billion, with large declines in domestic financial sector profits and smaller declines among nonfinancial corporations and overseas earnings. Industry-level data showed that private goods-producing industries contracted by 6.9 percent, with sharp pullbacks in nondurable manufacturing (especially petroleum and coal products) and mining. Private services-producing industries declined by 0.8 percent, led by retail trade and finance and insurance, though real estate and rental sectors posted gains. Government output grew 2.0 percent, largely due to increases at the state and local level. Gross output across the economy rose 2.0 percent overall, with services sectors growing 3.3 percent, partially offset by slight contraction in goods-producing sectors. Overall, the first quarter marked a transition period of economic turbulence, with strong underlying demand colliding with inventory adjustments, pandemic aftershocks, and accelerating inflation."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) contracted at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the second quarter of 2022, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This followed a decline of 1.6 percent in the first quarter, marking two consecutive quarters of negative growth—technically satisfying a common, though unofficial, definition of recession. The third estimate was consistent with the second estimate, although upward revisions to consumer spending were offset by downward revisions to exports. Imports, which are a subtraction in GDP, were revised slightly lower. The contraction in GDP reflected sharp declines in private inventory investment, residential fixed investment, federal government spending, and state and local government spending. These were partially offset by increases in exports and consumer spending. Inventory declines were led by retail trade, notably among 'other' general merchandise stores. Residential fixed investment fell due to declines in real estate brokerage commissions and investment in 'other' structures. Federal government spending dropped due to sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which counted as a reduction in federal consumption expenditures without a direct offset to GDP. State and local government investment in structures also weakened. Offsetting these drags, exports rose across both goods and services categories, and consumer spending increased, led by services such as food services, accommodations, and miscellaneous services. Inflation remained highly elevated: the price index for gross domestic purchases rose 8.5 percent, while the PCE price index climbed 7.3 percent. Core PCE, excluding food and energy, increased 4.7 percent. Current-dollar GDP grew 8.5 percent ($508.0 billion) to reach a level of $25.25 trillion. Incomes showed mixed results. Current-dollar personal income rose $305.7 billion, driven by compensation increases, but disposable personal income only increased 5.7 percent, while real disposable income fell by 1.5 percent. The personal saving rate declined to 3.4 percent, the lowest since 2008. On the production side, real gross domestic income (GDI) grew by only 0.1 percent, and the average of real GDP and GDI declined 0.3 percent, highlighting an overall loss of momentum in economic activity. Corporate profits rose $131.6 billion, although this was a downward revision relative to earlier estimates. Profits of domestic financial corporations declined by $46.0 billion, while nonfinancial corporate profits rose $152.2 billion. Industry data showed significant divergence: private goods-producing industries contracted sharply, down 10.4 percent, led by declines in construction and nondurable goods manufacturing (especially chemical products). Private services-producing industries expanded 2.0 percent, supported by gains in health care, professional and scientific services, real estate, and accommodation and food services. Government output declined slightly by 0.2 percent, reflecting decreases at both the federal and state and local levels. Gross output increased by 1.7 percent overall, with services sectors up 3.6 percent, goods sectors down 3.0 percent, and government output up 0.8 percent. The second quarter thus portrayed an economy grappling with rapid inflation, eroding household purchasing power, declining real incomes, and a significant softening in investment, despite some resilience in consumer services and exports."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) rebounded in the third quarter of 2022, increasing at an annual rate of 3.2 percent according to the 'third' estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This marked a notable turnaround following two consecutive quarters of contraction earlier in the year (-1.6% in Q1 and -0.6% in Q2). The upward revision from the previous 2.9 percent estimate primarily reflected stronger-than-expected consumer spending and nonresidential fixed investment, partly offset by lower private inventory investment. The increase in real GDP was driven by broad-based improvements: exports rose sharply across goods and services, consumer spending rebounded, nonresidential fixed investment strengthened, and both state and local as well as federal government spending contributed positively. Imports, which subtract from GDP, declined notably during the quarter. Export growth was led by industrial supplies and nonautomotive capital goods on the goods side, and by business services and travel on the services side. Consumer spending was boosted by increased expenditures on services, particularly health care and 'other' services, while spending on goods declined, especially for motor vehicles and food and beverages. Investment in equipment and intellectual property rose, although investment in structures declined. Residential fixed investment fell sharply, with notable drops in new single-family construction and real estate brokerage activity. Private inventory investment, particularly in retail trade, also contracted. On the price side, inflation pressures remained elevated but showed some signs of moderation. The price index for gross domestic purchases rose 4.8 percent, while the PCE price index increased 4.3 percent; core PCE excluding food and energy rose 4.7 percent. Current-dollar GDP increased 7.7 percent ($475.5 billion) to reach $25.72 trillion. Personal income growth was solid, with current-dollar personal income rising $283.1 billion, driven by compensation gains. However, the personal saving rate dropped to 2.7 percent, reflecting continued pressure on households' disposable incomes from inflation. Real disposable personal income grew only 1.0 percent. Corporate profits softened, with overall corporate profits declining slightly by $1.3 billion. Financial corporations' profits fell $1.8 billion, while nonfinancial corporate profits rose $16.1 billion. Rest-of-the-world profits declined $15.5 billion. On the production side, real gross domestic income (GDI) grew 0.8 percent, and the average of real GDP and GDI rose 2.0 percent, indicating moderate but positive underlying economic momentum. By industry, private services-producing industries led growth (+4.9%), supported by strong performances in information services, professional and technical services, and real estate sectors. Private goods-producing industries contracted (-1.3%) due to continued weakness in construction, despite a modest increase in mining activity. Government output increased 0.6 percent, mainly due to higher state and local spending. Gross output for the economy rose 2.5 percent overall, with services sectors up 3.0 percent, goods sectors up 1.2 percent, and government up 2.3 percent. The third quarter marked an important stabilization point for the U.S. economy after a turbulent first half of the year, although underlying risks from inflation, rising interest rates, and weakening global demand remained elevated heading into late 2022."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to the 'third' estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This marked a deceleration from the 3.2 percent growth recorded in the third quarter. The deceleration primarily reflected slower growth in consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment, and state and local government spending, along with a downturn in exports. Partially offsetting these effects were increases in private inventory investment and federal government spending. Consumer spending growth was driven by services—particularly health care and housing/utilities—while goods consumption declined, with jewelry and other durable goods leading the decrease. Private inventory investment contributed positively, especially in manufacturing (petroleum and coal products) and utilities. Nonresidential fixed investment rose, supported by structures and intellectual property products, despite a decline in equipment investment. Government spending also rose, led by nondefense expenditures at the federal level and compensation growth at state and local levels. Exports declined, notably in nondurable goods excluding petroleum, although service exports such as travel increased. Imports, which are subtracted in GDP calculations, fell during the quarter, easing the drag on growth. Inflation remained elevated but moderated slightly; the gross domestic purchases price index rose 3.6 percent, while the PCE price index increased 3.7 percent. Core PCE inflation, excluding food and energy, rose 4.4 percent. Current-dollar GDP rose 6.6 percent ($414.1 billion) to $26.14 trillion. Personal income grew $398.8 billion, led by gains in private wages and salaries and government social benefits, including one-time refundable tax credits issued by several states. Real disposable personal income rose 5.0 percent, and the personal saving rate increased slightly to 4.0 percent. Corporate profits weakened: overall corporate profits fell by $60.5 billion, with financial corporations seeing a $59.0 billion decline. Real gross domestic income (GDI) unexpectedly contracted by 1.1 percent, signaling divergence from GDP, and the average of real GDP and GDI rose by a modest 0.7 percent. By industry, private goods-producing industries rose 4.0 percent, led by durable goods manufacturing and mining, although construction fell. Private services-producing industries grew 2.3 percent, driven by professional services, retail trade, health care, and information sectors, though finance, insurance, and real estate sectors posted declines. Government output increased 2.1 percent, supported by gains at both federal and state/local levels. Real gross output across the economy rose 1.0 percent, reflecting stronger goods and government sectors but weaker services. For the full year 2022, real GDP grew 2.1 percent, a significant slowdown from 5.9 percent growth in 2021, due to higher inflation and tighter monetary conditions. Private goods-producing industries shrank 2.8 percent in 2022, while private services-producing industries expanded 3.4 percent. Overall corporate profits grew $181.5 billion in 2022, much slower than the $511.0 billion increase in 2021, signaling growing pressures on margins heading into 2023. Inflationary pressures remained strong in 2022, with the gross domestic purchases price index up 6.8 percent for the year. The U.S. economy thus ended 2022 on a weaker but still expanding footing, facing headwinds from slowing global demand, tightening financial conditions, and persistent inflationary pressures."

The third estimate reflected significant upward revisions compared to earlier estimates, driven by stronger consumer spending and exports, although nonresidential fixed investment and federal government spending were revised downward. The advance in GDP was supported by increases in consumer spending, exports, state and local government spending, federal government spending, and nonresidential fixed investment, partly offset by declines in private inventory investment and residential fixed investment. Imports increased and exerted a negative impact on GDP calculations. The deceleration relative to the fourth quarter primarily reflected a downturn in private inventory investment and a slowdown in nonresidential fixed investment, which were partially offset by an acceleration in consumer spending and a rebound in exports. Inflation pressures remained present but moderate relative to 2022 levels: the gross domestic purchases price index rose 3.8 percent, while the PCE price index increased 4.1 percent, and core PCE inflation excluding food and energy rose 4.9 percent. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP expanded by 6.1 percent ($391.8 billion) to reach a level of $26.53 trillion. Personal income rose by $278.0 billion, mainly due to increases in private wages and salaries and government social benefits. Real disposable personal income increased 8.5 percent, with the personal saving rate ticking up to 4.3 percent. However, corporate profits weakened notably: profits from current production fell by $121.5 billion, reflecting declines in both financial and nonfinancial corporate sectors. Real gross domestic income (GDI) declined 1.8 percent, signaling potential softening in underlying economic activity, although the average of real GDP and GDI registered a modest 0.1 percent increase. By industry, private services-producing industries led the growth with a 2.6 percent expansion, driven by health care, retail trade, real estate, and accommodation and food services, partially offset by declines in finance and insurance. Government output rose 2.7 percent, while private goods-producing industries contracted 0.7 percent, led by declines in both durable and nondurable goods manufacturing. Real gross output increased 2.7 percent across the economy, with broad contributions from both private services and government sectors.

The 'third' estimate for Q2 reflected a downward revision to consumer spending but upward revisions to nonresidential fixed investment, exports, and inventory investment. Imports, which are subtracted in the calculation of GDP, were also revised downward. Growth in the second quarter was driven by increases in nonresidential fixed investment, consumer spending, and state and local government spending, partially offset by a decline in exports. Compared to Q1, the slight deceleration in real GDP was primarily due to slower consumer spending, a downturn in exports, and slower federal government spending, while a rebound in private inventory investment and an acceleration in nonresidential fixed investment provided partial offsets. Current-dollar GDP increased by 3.8 percent, or $249.4 billion, reaching $27.06 trillion, a slight downward revision. Inflation pressures eased further, with the gross domestic purchases price index increasing only 1.4 percent, and the PCE price index rising 2.5 percent, stable from prior estimates.

This marks a sharp acceleration from the 2.1 percent growth rate recorded in the second quarter. The third estimate reflected a downward revision to consumer spending but upward revisions to state and local government spending, nonresidential fixed investment, residential investment, and federal government spending. Imports, which subtract from GDP, were also revised downward, mitigating the effect of increased import volumes. Growth in the third quarter was broad-based, driven by strong contributions from consumer spending, private inventory investment, exports, state and local government spending, federal government spending, residential fixed investment, and nonresidential fixed investment. Within consumer spending, durable goods (notably motor vehicles and parts) and services (particularly health care and financial services) provided major support. Private inventory accumulation was especially robust, as businesses restocked goods following tighter supply conditions earlier in the year. On the inflation front, pressures continued to moderate: the price index for gross domestic purchases rose 2.9 percent, and the PCE price index rose only 2.6 percent, with core PCE (excluding food and energy) at just 2.0 percent—an encouraging sign for policymakers. In current-dollar terms, GDP rose 8.3 percent, or $547.1 billion, to a level of $27.61 trillion. Income measures showed a more moderate expansion. Current-dollar personal income rose $196.2 billion, led by gains in compensation and nonfarm proprietors' income, although personal current transfer receipts declined. Real disposable personal income increased 0.3 percent, helping the personal saving rate rise slightly to 4.2 percent. On the corporate side, profits from current production increased $108.7 billion. Nonfinancial corporate profits rose sharply by $90.8 billion, while financial corporations posted a more modest gain of $9.0 billion. Real gross domestic income (GDI) increased 1.5 percent, resulting in an average growth rate of 3.2 percent when GDP and GDI are combined. Sectorally, private goods-producing industries grew a strong 10.2 percent, led by nondurable goods manufacturing (notably chemicals) and construction. Private services-producing industries grew 4.1 percent, driven by retail trade, information, and finance and insurance, while government output expanded by 2.0 percent, mainly at the state and local levels. Overall, the third quarter saw a remarkable rebound in economic momentum, fueled by resilient consumers, strong business investment, and moderating inflation."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This marked a moderation from the exceptionally strong 4.9 percent growth seen in the third quarter. The third estimate reflected upward revisions to consumer spending and nonresidential fixed investment, which were partly offset by a downward revision to private inventory investment. The growth in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by increases in consumer spending, state and local government spending, exports, nonresidential fixed investment, federal government spending, and residential fixed investment, though partially offset by a decline in private inventories. Imports, which subtract from GDP, increased but at a slower rate than earlier in the year. In nominal terms, current-dollar GDP rose by 5.1 percent, or $346.9 billion, reaching a level of $27.96 trillion. Inflation pressures continued to cool: the price index for gross domestic purchases rose only 1.9 percent, and the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy increased just 2.0 percent. Current-dollar personal income expanded by $230.2 billion, led by increases in private wages and salaries, proprietors' income, and income from assets. Real disposable personal income rose by 2.0 percent, helping sustain a personal saving rate of 4.0 percent. Corporate profits showed solid growth, with profits from current production rising by $133.5 billion. Profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations surged $136.5 billion, while financial corporations posted a smaller gain of $5.9 billion. Real gross domestic income (GDI) rebounded strongly, increasing 4.8 percent after a weaker performance earlier in the year. Sectorally, private goods-producing industries grew 7.0 percent, led by strong expansions in nondurable goods manufacturing (notably petroleum, coal, and chemical products), durable goods manufacturing (machinery), and construction. Private services-producing industries grew by 2.6 percent, supported by retail trade, health care and social assistance, utilities, and professional, scientific, and technical services. The government sector grew 3.1 percent, reflecting robust spending at both the federal and state and local levels. Real gross output increased 2.4 percent across the economy, driven by increases in both private industries and government. For the full year 2023, real GDP rose 2.5 percent, compared to 1.9 percent in 2022, supported by gains in consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment, government spending, and exports. Corporate profits for the year grew modestly by $49.3 billion, reflecting solid but slower momentum compared to prior years. Overall, the fourth quarter concluded a year of resilient economic growth despite tighter monetary policy and ongoing global uncertainties, with notable strength in investment, government spending, and cooling inflationary pressures."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the first quarter of 2024, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This marks a noticeable deceleration compared to the 3.4 percent growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. The third estimate reflected upward revisions to nonresidential fixed investment, government spending, and downward revisions to imports, partially offset by a downward revision to consumer spending. Growth in the first quarter was primarily driven by increases in consumer spending, residential fixed investment, nonresidential fixed investment, and state and local government spending, although private inventory investment posted a notable drag on GDP. Imports, which subtract from GDP, accelerated during the quarter. On a nominal basis, current-dollar GDP grew by 4.5 percent, or $312.2 billion, reaching a level of $28.27 trillion. Inflation indicators showed modest upward revisions: the price index for gross domestic purchases rose 3.1 percent, while the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 3.4 percent, and the core PCE price index excluding food and energy rose 3.7 percent. Personal income expanded by $396.8 billion in current-dollar terms, largely driven by increases in private wages and salaries and government social benefits. Disposable personal income rose by 4.8 percent, though real disposable income rose only 1.3 percent, reflecting the impact of inflation. The personal saving rate remained steady at 3.8 percent. Corporate profits presented a mixed picture, with overall profits from current production declining by $47.1 billion. Financial corporations saw an increase of $65.0 billion in profits, but nonfinancial corporations posted a sharp decline of $114.5 billion. Profits from the rest-of-the-world were modestly positive but revised downward to a $2.3 billion gain. Real gross domestic income (GDI) rose by 1.3 percent, and the average of real GDP and GDI, a broader measure of U.S. economic activity, increased 1.4 percent for the quarter. Sectorally, private goods-producing industries contracted by 1.1 percent, led by declines in durable goods (notably primary metals) and nondurable goods (especially petroleum and coal products) manufacturing. However, construction activity partially offset these declines. Private services-producing industries grew by 1.9 percent, driven by strong performance in retail trade (motor vehicles and parts dealers), finance and insurance, and health care and social assistance. Government spending rose by 2.3 percent, with both state and local and federal government contributing positively. Real gross output across the economy increased by 2.5 percent, with gains seen in private goods-producing industries (1.2 percent), private services-producing industries (3.1 percent), and government (1.7 percent). Overall, the first quarter of 2024 reflected a moderate pace of economic growth, with resilient investment and government spending offsetting some consumer weakness and inventory drawdowns, as inflation remained persistent but stable."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 3.0 percent in the second quarter of 2024, according to the 'third' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This marked an acceleration compared to the 1.6 percent growth recorded in the first quarter (revised). The upward momentum primarily reflected stronger contributions from consumer spending, private inventory investment, and nonresidential fixed investment. The third estimate incorporated upward revisions to private inventory investment and federal government spending, offset somewhat by downward revisions to nonresidential fixed investment and exports. Imports, which are a subtraction in GDP calculation, were revised up. Overall, growth dynamics were driven by an upturn in private inventory investment and an acceleration in consumer spending, even as residential fixed investment declined. Nominal GDP rose by 5.6 percent, or $392.6 billion, reaching $29.02 trillion. Inflation remained moderate, with the price index for gross domestic purchases increasing 2.4 percent, and the PCE price index rising 2.5 percent. Core PCE (excluding food and energy) advanced 2.8 percent. Personal income rose robustly, increasing by $315.7 billion, bolstered by gains in compensation and transfer receipts. Disposable personal income increased 5.0 percent, while real disposable income rose 2.4 percent. The personal saving rate was 5.2 percent for the quarter, suggesting continued consumer caution amid elevated interest rates. Corporate profits from current production increased $132.5 billion, a significant upward revision from previous estimates. Profits for domestic financial corporations rose by $42.5 billion, while domestic nonfinancial corporations posted a $108.8 billion increase, though rest-of-the-world profits fell modestly. Real gross domestic income (GDI) increased 3.4 percent, substantially stronger than initially reported, and the average of real GDP and GDI rose 3.2 percent, signaling solid underlying economic momentum. By industry, private goods-producing industries surged by 6.9 percent, powered by gains in both nondurable goods manufacturing (especially petroleum and coal products) and durable goods manufacturing (notably motor vehicles and parts). Private services-producing industries rose by 2.4 percent, with finance and insurance, health care, and real estate being major contributors. Government activity expanded by 0.8 percent, reflecting increases in both federal and state and local spending. Real gross output for the economy increased 1.8 percent, with gains across goods-producing, services-producing, and government sectors. Additionally, the release incorporated the 2024 Annual Update of the National Economic Accounts, revising historical GDP and GDI data back to 2019 and reflecting higher-than-previously-estimated growth rates for the 2018–2023 period. Overall, the second quarter of 2024 painted a picture of a resilient economy with broad-based sectoral strength, moderate inflation, and a solid rebound in corporate profitability."

      "text": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the third quarter of 2024, according to the 'third' estimate released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This represented a slight acceleration compared to the 3.0 percent increase recorded in the second quarter. The third estimate incorporated stronger-than-previously-estimated growth in exports and consumer spending, although partly offset by a downward revision to private inventory investment. Imports, which subtract from GDP, were revised up. The growth in real GDP was driven by broad-based gains, including expansions in consumer spending, exports, nonresidential fixed investment, and federal government spending. The acceleration compared to the second quarter largely reflected stronger export activity, an upturn in consumer spending, and a boost in federal government expenditures, although these were tempered by a deeper decline in private inventory investment and residential fixed investment. Nominal GDP expanded at a 5.0 percent annual rate, or $358.2 billion, reaching a level of $29.37 trillion. Inflation pressures remained modest, with the price index for gross domestic purchases increasing 1.9 percent, while the PCE price index rose by 1.5 percent. Core PCE (excluding food and energy) rose 2.2 percent. Personal income increased by $191.7 billion, supported by gains in compensation and transfer receipts. Disposable personal income grew by 2.7 percent, while real disposable personal income rose 1.1 percent. The personal saving rate stood at 4.3 percent. Real gross domestic income (GDI) rose 2.1 percent in the third quarter, and the average of GDP and GDI rose 2.6 percent, signaling solid, although slightly uneven, economic activity across indicators. Corporate profits from current production decreased by $15.0 billion, reflecting mixed sectoral trends. Domestic financial corporations saw a $3.0 billion increase in profits, while nonfinancial corporations registered a $24.9 billion gain. However, rest-of-the-world profits fell sharply by $42.9 billion. Industry data showed that private goods-producing industries increased by 1.5 percent, led by durable goods manufacturing (notably transportation equipment) and nondurable goods manufacturing (notably chemical products). Private services-producing industries grew 3.6 percent, with key contributions from retail trade, health care and social assistance, and information services. Government value added rose by 2.1 percent, driven by increased activity at the state and local levels. Real gross output rose by 3.2 percent across the economy, with gains in private services (+4.0%), government (+3.5%), and a more modest rise in private goods (+0.6%). In total, 17 of 22 major industry groups contributed to the growth in gross output. The third quarter thus underscored continued resilience in the U.S. economy, supported by broad-based consumer and business strength amid moderating inflation trends."

      "text": "In the second quarter of 1996, the U.S. current-account deficit widened to $38.8 billion, up from a revised $34.9 billion in the first quarter, based on preliminary estimates by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This increase reflects a broadening deficit in goods and services as well as a shift from surplus to deficit in investment income. The deficit on goods and services grew to $27.9 billion, with the goods deficit reaching $46.8 billion (up from $42.7 billion), due to stronger import activity. Goods exports rose to $153.3 billion from $150.0 billion, driven by nonagricultural exports. Goods imports increased significantly to $200.1 billion from $192.8 billion, with balanced growth in petroleum and nonpetroleum imports. The services surplus edged up to $19.0 billion (from $18.5 billion), supported by increased receipts in military agency contracts and private services. Receipts grew to $56.0 billion while payments rose to $37.1 billion, with notable changes in transportation and travel categories. Investment income swung into a deficit of $1.6 billion from a $0.3 billion surplus, as income payments on foreign-owned U.S. assets rose sharply to $49.8 billion. This increase was driven by higher direct investment payments and government obligations. Income receipts on U.S. assets abroad also rose to $48.2 billion, primarily from direct investment and private flows. Net unilateral transfers declined to $9.3 billion (from $10.9 billion), largely due to a normalization of government grant outflows following delayed payments from late 1995. On the capital account, net recorded inflows were $31.2 billion, modestly higher than the $30.7 billion seen in Q1. U.S. residents increased their holdings of foreign assets by $49.2 billion, a slower pace than the $68.8 billion seen in Q1, driven by changes in bank claims and securities purchases. Foreign residents acquired $80.3 billion in U.S. assets, a deceleration from $99.5 billion in the prior quarter. Notably, private foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities more than doubled to $31.7 billion, driven by investment funds in the Caribbean. Foreign purchases of other U.S. securities declined to $28.6 billion. Net capital inflows from foreign direct investment dropped significantly to $10.7 billion (from $28.7 billion), reflecting lower equity inflows and intercompany debt activity. Foreign official assets in the U.S. increased by $13.2 billion, down from $52.0 billion, as many industrial countries reduced their dollar accumulation. The statistical discrepancy — capturing errors and omissions — registered as an inflow of $7.6 billion. The U.S. dollar appreciated 2% on a trade-weighted average basis against major industrial country currencies during the quarter."

The overall goods and services deficit rose to $33.8 billion from $28.6 billion. Within this category, the goods trade deficit widened to $51.6 billion (up from $47.0 billion), driven by decreased goods exports (down to $149.9 billion from $153.1 billion) and increased goods imports (up to $201.5 billion from $200.1 billion). The decline in exports was largely attributable to reduced nonagricultural shipments, while imports of both petroleum and nonpetroleum products rose. The surplus on services narrowed slightly to $17.8 billion, as service receipts fell to $55.6 billion and payments increased to $37.8 billion. Travel and passenger fare revenues declined, while royalty and license fee payments rose, notably due to Olympic broadcast rights. Investment income also saw a deterioration, with the deficit growing to $4.7 billion from $2.3 billion. This shift was driven by rising income payments on foreign-owned U.S. assets, which jumped to $53.0 billion (from $50.3 billion), primarily due to higher U.S. government obligations and foreign-held Treasury securities. Receipts on U.S. assets abroad edged up to $48.3 billion, supported by 'other' private income streams. Net unilateral transfers remained nearly unchanged at $9.4 billion. On the capital account, net recorded capital inflows surged to $69.3 billion in Q3, up from $49.8 billion in Q2, fueled by an acceleration in foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets. U.S. assets abroad rose by $54.7 billion, with U.S. bank claims increasing by $32.5 billion — a significant rebound from Q2. Net U.S. purchases of foreign securities increased modestly to $21.3 billion, driven by a surge in foreign bond purchases, even as equity purchases declined. Direct investment outflows abroad dropped sharply to $8.4 billion (from $26.2 billion), largely due to a shift toward net intercompany debt inflows. U.S. official reserve assets fell by $7.5 billion, as Mexico repaid $7.0 billion under prior swap agreements. Meanwhile, foreign holdings of U.S. assets jumped by $124.0 billion in Q3. A record $42.0 billion in foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities reflected a rotation from equities to fixed income. Purchases of other U.S. securities rose to $33.0 billion, despite declining stock demand, offset by increased bond interest. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. also strengthened to $25.1 billion (up from $17.4 billion), led by higher equity capital inflows, intercompany debt, and reinvested earnings. Foreign official asset accumulation climbed to $23.6 billion, with developing nations increasing their dollar reserves. The statistical discrepancy was an outflow of $21.4 billion, widening from $9.6 billion in Q2. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar depreciated by 1% on a trade-weighted basis against ten major industrial country currencies during the quarter."

The goods and services deficit declined to $26.3 billion, down from $34.3 billion. The goods trade deficit fell to $45.3 billion (from $51.9 billion), driven by rising exports and relatively smaller import growth. Goods exports rose strongly to $158.4 billion (from $150.1 billion), supported by increases in both nonagricultural and agricultural shipments. Imports of goods also rose, reaching $203.7 billion (from $202.0 billion), with gains in both petroleum and nonpetroleum categories. The services surplus expanded to $19.0 billion (from $17.6 billion), with receipts increasing to $57.4 billion — gains were broad-based across service categories. Service payments rose slightly to $38.5 billion, though royalties and license fees declined following one-time Olympic broadcast-related payments in Q3. The investment income deficit narrowed to $2.4 billion (from $4.1 billion), as income receipts increased to $52.6 billion (from $48.7 billion) due to higher direct investment returns and 'other' private receipts. Income payments rose to $55.0 billion, largely due to increases in U.S. Government and private obligations. Net unilateral transfers climbed to $12.6 billion (from $9.5 billion), mainly due to U.S. Government grants to Israel. On the capital side, net recorded capital inflows were $68.0 billion, slightly below Q3’s $69.7 billion, as both U.S. acquisitions abroad and foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets accelerated. U.S. assets abroad increased by $114.1 billion, up significantly from $73.3 billion. U.S. banks expanded their foreign claims by $56.7 billion (up from $33.2 billion), reflecting increased demand for year-end merger financing and strong foreign purchases of U.S. Treasuries. Net U.S. purchases of foreign securities rose to $27.0 billion, driven by bond purchases, though stock purchases also increased. Direct investment outflows surged to $29.8 billion (from $9.1 billion), due to higher reinvested earnings and a large shift toward intercompany debt outflows. U.S. official reserve assets increased slightly by $0.3 billion after a $7.5 billion decline in Q3 (which included Mexico’s debt repayment). Foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets totaled $182.0 billion in Q4, sharply higher than Q3’s $143.0 billion. U.S. bank liabilities to foreigners jumped by $33.2 billion, compared to a $1.2 billion decrease in Q3, as U.S. banks borrowed heavily to fund surging demand and rising Treasury sales. Foreign private purchases of U.S. Treasury securities hit a record $67.3 billion, up from $43.4 billion, as rising bond prices, favorable interest differentials, and dollar appreciation increased attractiveness. Foreign purchases of non-Treasury U.S. securities fell slightly to $31.7 billion (from $34.8 billion), with reduced stock and bond activity. Foreign direct investment inflows into the U.S. dropped to $16.8 billion (from $21.1 billion), due to a reversal in intercompany debt. Foreign official asset accumulation rose to $33.0 billion (from $24.2 billion), largely from developing economies. The statistical discrepancy widened to an outflow of $26.6 billion (from $21.8 billion). The U.S. dollar appreciated 1% on a trade-weighted basis against ten industrial countries in Q4."

This deterioration was due primarily to a shift to a deficit in investment income and a rising goods and services deficit. Net unilateral transfers also decreased, partially offsetting these trends. The goods and services deficit expanded to $29.1 billion from $26.2 billion. Within this category, the goods deficit rose to $49.8 billion, driven by higher imports ($212.3 billion, up from $206.0 billion) that exceeded the rise in exports ($162.5 billion, up from $157.8 billion). Nonagricultural exports drove export growth, while agricultural exports declined. Import growth was led by nonpetroleum products, as petroleum imports actually decreased. The services surplus narrowed to $20.7 billion (from $22.0 billion), as service payments increased to $41.3 billion and receipts only slightly increased to $62.0 billion. The increase in payments was largely due to higher spending on travel, passenger fares, and private services. The investment income balance swung into a $3.1 billion deficit after a $1.3 billion surplus in Q4 1996. Receipts on U.S. assets abroad remained stable at $55.0 billion, but income payments to foreign asset holders in the U.S. rose sharply to $58.1 billion, with increases across all major components. Net unilateral transfers fell to $8.7 billion (from $11.9 billion), reflecting a decline from special U.S. Government grants in the previous quarter. On the capital account, net recorded capital inflows reached $59.1 billion (up from $40.1 billion), as capital inflows slowed less than outflows. U.S. assets abroad increased by $99.8 billion, down from the massive $154.4 billion rise in Q4. U.S. bank claims rose by $56.6 billion (compared to $66.7 billion), as interbank claims and Caribbean bond fund activity both moderated. Net U.S. purchases of foreign securities dropped to $14.5 billion (from $30.2 billion), primarily due to a sharp slowdown in bond purchases. Direct investment outflows declined to $24.6 billion (from $30.9 billion), with stronger equity outflows offset by a large reversal to net inflows in intercompany debt. U.S. official reserves decreased by $4.5 billion, mainly due to the final $3.5 billion repayment by Mexico on prior swap agreements. Foreign investment in the U.S. remained strong at $158.9 billion, though down from $194.6 billion in Q4. U.S. bank liabilities to foreigners rose by $18.9 billion (slowing from $39.0 billion), while net foreign private purchases of U.S. Treasury securities and currency reached $46.4 billion (down from $75.3 billion), driven by a pullback from Caribbean-based mutual funds. Purchases from Europe and Asia remained robust. Non-Treasury securities saw a record $38.7 billion in foreign purchases, largely from a surge in U.S. stock demand. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. rose to $21.7 billion (from $17.7 billion), with increases in intercompany debt and reinvested earnings. Foreign official asset holdings grew by $28.3 billion, with industrial country accumulation strengthening. The statistical discrepancy was an outflow of $18.1 billion, wider than the $3.3 billion outflow in Q4.

The improvement was primarily due to a smaller deficit in goods and services, which outweighed an increase in the investment income deficit and higher unilateral transfers. The goods and services deficit decreased to $26.4 billion from $29.3 billion. Within this, the goods deficit narrowed to $46.9 billion, as exports rose to $171.5 billion from $162.5 billion, led by nonagricultural goods, while imports also increased to $218.4 billion, driven by nonpetroleum products. The services surplus held steady at $20.5 billion. Service receipts rose modestly to $62.6 billion, with growth in private services and military sales partly offset by a drop in travel. Service payments climbed to $42.1 billion, with increases in royalties, private services, and transportation. The investment income deficit grew to $3.6 billion, up from $2.0 billion. Receipts on U.S. assets abroad increased to $58.6 billion (from $55.3 billion), mainly due to stronger direct investment and private flows. However, payments on foreign-held U.S. assets also rose to $62.1 billion (from $57.3 billion), with broad-based increases across asset categories. Net unilateral transfers rose slightly to $9.1 billion, with all components contributing. On the capital account, net recorded inflows reached $56.2 billion, up from $54.3 billion. U.S. asset acquisition abroad slowed to $95.5 billion (from $128.0 billion). Bank claims on foreigners rose by $29.6 billion, down sharply from Q1's $62.0 billion, reflecting reduced demand for U.S. bank credit abroad. U.S. purchases of foreign securities increased to $21.3 billion (from $14.5 billion), including stronger purchases of both foreign bonds and Japanese equities. Outflows from U.S. direct investment abroad rose to $29.1 billion (from $26.4 billion), driven by a swing to intercompany debt outflows, while equity and reinvested earnings remained strong. U.S. official reserves increased modestly by $0.2 billion. Foreign investment in U.S. assets totaled $151.6 billion, down from $182.2 billion in Q1. U.S. bank liabilities to foreigners increased $27.1 billion (from $17.4 billion), despite slower credit demand. Foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities and currency flows amounted to $50.8 billion, nearly unchanged from Q1, though Treasury bond demand softened—especially from the U.K. and Caribbean mutual funds. Non-Treasury securities hit a record $51.5 billion in net foreign purchases, driven by surging demand for U.S. stocks. Foreign direct investment inflows decreased slightly to $28.9 billion (from $30.6 billion), with weaker intercompany debt and equity capital flows, while reinvested earnings were stable. Foreign official holdings declined by $3.7 billion, reversing a $28.9 billion gain, due to asset selloffs by non-OPEC developing countries. The statistical discrepancy was an outflow of $17.1 billion (up from $14.3 billion).

The goods and services deficit rose to $29.6 billion from $25.6 billion. The goods trade deficit expanded to $51.5 billion (from $47.1 billion), as exports slipped to $170.6 billion (from $171.4 billion), driven by weaker nonagricultural shipments, while imports rose to $222.1 billion, fueled by nonpetroleum goods. The services surplus edged up to $21.9 billion (from $21.5 billion), with service receipts increasing to $64.4 billion due to gains in private services and travel.

The investment income deficit remained stable at $3.3 billion (slightly up from $3.2 billion), with income receipts rising to $60.6 billion and payments increasing to $63.9 billion. Most gains in receipts came from private income flows. Net unilateral transfers were stable at $9.2 billion. On the capital side, net recorded capital inflows increased to $68.0 billion, up from $52.1 billion, reflecting a larger rise in foreign investment in U.S. assets than in U.S. investments abroad. U.S. assets abroad grew by $101.6 billion (up from $90.9 billion). Bank claims on foreigners increased $22.8 billion, reflecting higher lending for securities transactions and stronger deposits abroad. Net U.S. purchases of foreign securities jumped to $38.0 billion (from $21.8 billion), with strong activity in Western Europe and bond markets. Direct investment outflows declined to $24.7 billion (from $36.7 billion), driven by a shift to net intercompany debt inflows, despite higher equity outflows. Official reserve assets rose by $0.7 billion. Foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets totaled $169.5 billion, up from $143.0 billion. U.S. bank liabilities to foreigners rose by $14.1 billion, a smaller increase than Q2, though custody liabilities grew sharply. Net foreign private purchases of U.S. Treasury securities and currency totaled $43.5 billion, down from $49.9 billion, due to net sales by Japan partly offset by record purchases from Western Europe. Foreign demand for non-Treasury U.S. securities hit a record $60.8 billion, with both stocks and bonds reaching all-time highs—bolstered by record new bond issues by U.S. firms abroad. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. fell to $21.1 billion (from $26.6 billion), due to weaker intercompany debt flows, while equity and reinvested earnings rose. Foreign official assets in the U.S. increased by $22.5 billion, mostly from a few non-OPEC developing nations. The statistical discrepancy rose to an outflow of $25.8 billion (from $14.2 billion). The U.S. dollar appreciated 3% on a trade-weighted basis against major industrial currencies. Revisions to Q2 data include a downward revision of the current account deficit to $37.9 billion, with upward adjustments to the services surplus and downward adjustments to investment income and unilateral transfers."

      "text": "In the fourth quarter of 1997, the U.S. current-account deficit rose to $45.6 billion from a revised $43.1 billion in Q3. The increase was driven by higher net unilateral transfers, a larger investment income deficit, and a decline in the services surplus, despite an improvement in the goods trade balance. The goods and services deficit fell to $28.7 billion (from $29.9 billion). The goods deficit narrowed to $49.9 billion, as exports rose to $174.5 billion (from $170.3 billion) with gains in both agricultural and nonagricultural products. Imports also increased to $224.4 billion, led by nonpetroleum goods, while petroleum imports were stable. The services surplus declined to $21.2 billion (from $22.1 billion), as receipts dropped to $63.8 billion, with widespread declines across service categories. Payments rose slightly to $42.6 billion, with increases in travel, fares, transportation, and defense spending outweighing declines in private services and royalties. The investment income deficit expanded to $4.9 billion (from $4.1 billion). Receipts on U.S. assets abroad decreased slightly to $60.8 billion, reflecting a drop in direct investment income, while payments on foreign-held U.S. assets rose to $65.7 billion, with increases in government and private payments. Net unilateral transfers increased to $12.0 billion (from $9.1 billion), due largely to increased U.S. Government grants to Israel. On the capital account, net recorded inflows jumped to $85.2 billion (from $72.6 billion), as the slowdown in U.S. investment abroad outpaced the decline in foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets. U.S. assets abroad increased by $96.7 billion, down from $110.7 billion. U.S. bank claims rose $30.5 billion, nearly unchanged from Q3, as banks expanded interbank lending while U.S. customers withdrew funds from foreign banks. U.S. purchases of foreign securities collapsed to just $3.7 billion (from $39.2 billion), with net sales of foreign stocks due to Asian financial turmoil. Bond purchases also slowed significantly. Direct investment outflows rose sharply to $32.9 billion (from $22.8 billion), driven by higher equity investments and reinvested earnings, partly offset by net intercompany debt inflows. U.S. official reserves increased by $4.5 billion, largely due to IMF loans to Indonesia and Korea, which boosted the U.S. reserve position in the IMF. Foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets totaled $181.9 billion, down slightly from $183.3 billion. Bank liabilities to foreigners surged by a record $87.0 billion, with strong inflows from Japan, Western Europe, and the Caribbean. Net private foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities and currency reached $43.7 billion (up slightly from $42.9 billion), though Treasury bond purchases fell to $33.8 billion. Currency outflows increased to $9.9 billion. Demand for other U.S. securities dropped, with purchases falling to $38.4 billion (from $60.4 billion), including a sharp decline in stock and bond purchases. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. totaled $24.6 billion, down slightly from $25.9 billion, with equity inflows rising but intercompany debt and reinvested earnings declining. Foreign official assets in the U.S. decreased by $27.2 billion (after a $21.9 billion increase), reflecting asset sales by both industrial and developing countries. The statistical discrepancy widened to -$39.6 billion (from -$29.5 billion), likely due to unrecorded short-term capital flows. The U.S. dollar depreciated by 1% on a trade-weighted basis against ten major industrial currencies during the quarter. Revisions to Q3 data included a higher estimate of the current-account deficit, now $43.1 billion, with upward revisions to the goods and investment income deficits and a downward adjustment to unilateral transfers."

      "text": "In the first quarter of 1998, the U.S. current-account deficit rose to $47.2 billion, up from a revised $45.0 billion in Q4 1997. The increase was mainly due to a growing deficit in goods and services, partially offset by reductions in the investment income deficit and net unilateral transfers. The goods and services deficit widened to $34.9 billion (from $28.5 billion). The goods trade deficit expanded to $55.7 billion, as exports declined to $171.5 billion (from $174.3 billion), driven by decreases in capital goods and industrial supplies, including both nonagricultural and agricultural products. Meanwhile, imports rose to $227.2 billion, supported by increases in consumer goods, vehicles, capital goods, and industrial supplies. Petroleum imports fell sharply due to price declines, despite higher volumes. The services surplus narrowed slightly to $20.8 billion (from $21.4 billion). Service receipts dipped to $64.9 billion due to declines in transportation and private services, while military-related transfers rose. Service payments increased to $44.1 billion, driven by higher travel, passenger fares, and royalties, although some transportation and private service categories fell. The investment income deficit improved to $3.1 billion (from $4.2 billion). Income receipts grew to $61.5 billion, mainly due to stronger direct investment and private income flows, while income payments remained stable at $64.6 billion, with a mix of increases and decreases across categories. Net unilateral transfers fell to $9.2 billion (from $12.3 billion), as government grants—particularly to Israel—normalized after elevated Q4 levels. On the capital account, net recorded inflows dropped sharply to $46.1 billion (from $97.1 billion), reflecting slower foreign investment in the U.S. and reduced U.S. asset purchases abroad. U.S. assets abroad increased by $44.7 billion (down from $123.4 billion), driven by a $12.9 billion decline in bank-reported claims, particularly interbank lending to Japan and Caribbean institutions. U.S. purchases of foreign securities slowed to $5.2 billion (from $8.0 billion), with stock purchases rising modestly but bond purchases declining due to lower issuance. Direct investment outflows fell to $30.9 billion (from $35.5 billion), as equity and intercompany debt outflows decreased while reinvested earnings rose slightly. U.S. official reserves increased modestly by $0.4 billion. Foreign investment in the U.S. dropped to $90.9 billion (from $220.5 billion). Bank liabilities to foreigners decreased by $41.2 billion, a reversal from the large Q4 inflows. Foreign purchases of U.S. securities excluding Treasuries surged to a record $76.7 billion, driven by $29.4 billion in stock purchases and $47.3 billion in bonds. Net foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities reversed to net sales of $1.4 billion (from $35.3 billion), as Caribbean funds became net sellers. Currency outflows dropped to $0.7 billion. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. declined to $25.0 billion (from $28.5 billion), due to lower intercompany debt and smaller changes in equity and earnings. Foreign official assets rose $10.2 billion (versus a $27.0 billion decline), with increases from developing countries. The statistical discrepancy turned positive at $1.1 billion, a sharp swing from a -$52.0 billion gap in Q4, likely due to better tracking of short-term capital flows. The U.S. dollar appreciated 3% on a trade-weighted basis against the currencies of ten major industrial nations during the quarter."

The goods and services deficit rose to $44.0 billion from $35.0 billion. The goods trade deficit jumped to $64.8 billion, as exports fell to $164.7 billion (from $171.5 billion), with broad-based declines across commodity groups. Imports increased to $229.5 billion (from $227.2 billion), led by rising nonpetroleum goods, particularly consumer products, while petroleum imports declined due to lower prices despite stable volume. The services surplus increased slightly to $20.9 billion (from $20.7 billion). Receipts rose to $65.5 billion, driven by gains in private services and travel, despite a decline in military sales. Payments increased to $44.6 billion, led by higher transportation and travel costs, though royalties and license fees declined. The investment income deficit grew to $3.2 billion (from $2.2 billion). Receipts remained flat at $62.5 billion, with gains in direct investment and U.S. Government receipts offset by lower private income. Payments rose to $65.7 billion, driven largely by increased direct investment income payments. Net unilateral transfers decreased to $9.3 billion (from $9.5 billion), primarily due to reduced U.S. Government grants.

U.S. assets abroad increased by $97.5 billion (up from $45.6 billion). U.S. bank claims rose $25.0 billion after falling in Q1, partly due to renewed lending to Western Europe. U.S. purchases of foreign securities climbed to $23.4 billion (from $7.0 billion), mainly through increased foreign bond activity. Outflows for direct investment increased to $40.3 billion (from $34.3 billion), led by higher equity capital and reinvested earnings, offset slightly by reduced intercompany debt flows. U.S. official reserves rose $1.9 billion (up from $0.4 billion). Foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets accelerated to $163.4 billion (from $95.5 billion). U.S. bank liabilities to foreigners increased $40.9 billion after a $50.5 billion Q1 decline, reflecting resumed borrowing to fund overseas lending. Foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities rebounded to $25.7 billion (from net sales of $1.7 billion), due to bond fund activity in the Caribbean. Currency shipments rose to $2.3 billion. Foreign purchases of non-Treasury U.S. securities declined to $69.5 billion (from $77.0 billion), due to a drop in stock purchases, though bond purchases set a record high. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. decreased to $22.0 billion (from $25.9 billion), as equity capital, reinvested earnings, and intercompany debt all declined.

The overall goods and services deficit rose to $45.8 billion (from $43.9 billion). The goods deficit held steady at $64.4 billion, as both exports and imports declined. Goods exports dropped to $163.6 billion (from $164.8 billion), with declines in both agricultural and nonagricultural categories. Goods imports fell to $227.9 billion (from $229.3 billion), driven by lower petroleum imports, while nonpetroleum imports remained flat. The services surplus fell to $18.6 billion (from $20.6 billion). Service receipts declined to $63.8 billion (from $65.8 billion), with reductions in travel, passenger fares, and royalties. Service payments were stable at $45.2 billion, with declines in travel and fares offset by increases in private services and transportation. The investment income deficit widened significantly to $5.5 billion (from $3.4 billion). Receipts on U.S. assets abroad decreased to $60.4 billion, with losses across direct investment, private, and government income. Payments rose to $65.9 billion, led by increases in direct investment and private income, partially offset by reduced government payments. Net unilateral transfers rose to $10.1 billion (from $9.4 billion), mainly due to higher U.S. Government grants. Net recorded capital inflows increased to $64.8 billion (from a revised $55.1 billion), as foreign investment slowed less than U.S. investment abroad. U.S. assets abroad rose $48.1 billion (down from $109.8 billion). Bank claims increased by $28.3 billion amid heightened demand for short-term credit in industrial countries, though lending to Caribbean bond funds declined late in the quarter. U.S. transactions in foreign securities shifted sharply to net sales of $17.0 billion (from net purchases of $27.9 billion), including $8.7 billion in bond sales and $8.3 billion in stock sales. Direct investment outflows fell to $21.2 billion (from $40.6 billion), due to lower equity outflows, a shift to net intercompany debt inflows, and decreased reinvested earnings. U.S. official reserves increased $2.0 billion. Foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets slowed to $112.9 billion (from $164.9 billion). Bank liabilities surged $82.7 billion (from $37.7 billion), as U.S. banks received significant funds from abroad and expanded custody liabilities related to short-term paper placements. Net foreign sales of U.S. Treasury securities totaled $0.3 billion (versus $26.9 billion in purchases in Q2), largely due to Caribbean fund liquidations. Foreign purchases of U.S. non-Treasury securities declined sharply to $22.9 billion (from $71.0 billion), including net sales of $5.4 billion in stocks and halved bond purchases at $28.3 billion. Foreign direct investment inflows rose to $27.1 billion (from $19.1 billion), driven by a doubling in equity inflows and slight increases in reinvested earnings, despite lower intercompany debt inflows.

The services surplus rose to $19.3 billion (from $18.4 billion), as exports climbed to $65.7 billion (from $63.9 billion), led by higher travel receipts. Imports rose to $46.5 billion (from $45.5 billion), primarily due to travel and transportation services. The investment income deficit decreased to $7.8 billion (from $9.2 billion). Receipts increased to $59.7 billion, with gains in direct investment income. Payments declined slightly to $67.4 billion, as higher direct investment outflows were more than offset by lower government and private payments. Net unilateral transfers rose to $13.0 billion (from $10.0 billion), largely from increased U.S. government grants to Israel. Capital inflows surged to $94.3 billion (from $38.3 billion), as foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets greatly outpaced U.S. acquisitions abroad. Two large stock-based acquisitions of U.S. firms by foreign companies affected both capital inflows (as direct investment) and outflows (as foreign securities purchases), canceling out in net flows but amplifying gross flows. U.S. assets abroad increased by $88.8 billion (up from $60.4 billion). Bank claims decreased by $22.5 billion (from a $32.0 billion increase), as U.S. financial institutions pulled back lending in response to crises in Russia, Brazil, and emerging Asia. Net U.S. purchases of foreign securities surged to $71.6 billion (from net sales of $17.1 billion), driven by $79.8 billion in stock purchases due to the two major cross-border M&A deals. Bond transactions recorded net sales of $8.2 billion, similar to Q3. U.S. direct investment abroad rose to $33.0 billion (from $23.3 billion), primarily due to reinvested earnings and increased intercompany debt outflows. Official reserves increased by $2.4 billion. Foreign investment in the U.S. rose sharply to $183.1 billion (from $98.7 billion). Bank liabilities fell by $21.6 billion (from +$77.0 billion), reflecting a flight to safety and reduced foreign lending, except for Japanese banks.

Real DPI (adjusted for inflation) increased 0.8 percent in June. Real PCE decreased 0.2 percent, driven by an 0.8 percent decline in durable goods, especially motor vehicles. Nondurable goods rose 0.1 percent; services fell 0.3 percent, largely due to lower electricity and gas expenditures. This report also includes annual revisions for 1993–1995. Personal income was revised up $0.9 billion in 1993, $2.9 billion in 1994, and $13.4 billion in 1995. Personal outlays were revised upward in each year.

Real DPI — DPI adjusted to remove price changes — increased 0.1 percent in June, the same increase as in May. Real PCE — PCE adjusted to remove price changes — increased 0.6 percent in June, compared with an increase of 0.7 percent in May. Purchases of durable goods increased 2.0 percent, compared with an increase of 3.9 percent; motor vehicle purchases accounted for most of the increase in each month. Purchases of nondurable goods increased 0.3 percent in June, compared with an increase of 0.4 percent in May. Purchases of services increased 0.4 percent, compared with an increase of 0.1 percent. Personal income and outlays are components of the national income and product accounts (NIPA's). The NIPA's usually are revised each July, to incorporate new source data that are more complete, more detailed, and otherwise more appropriate than data previously available. As part of the annual revision to the national income and product accounts, personal dividend income was redefined to exclude payments that reflect identifiable capital gains distributions; previously personal dividend income included capital gains distributions of regulated investment companies — that is, mutual funds. Personal income in the national accounts is income received by persons from participation in current production, from both government and business transfer payments, and from government interest; all other identifiable forms of capital gains were already excluded from personal income. This redefinition was made to better separate 'income from current production' from 'income attributable to capital gains on existing assets.' The redefinition results in a reduction in dividends and an offsetting increase in undistributed corporate profits. All series affected by the redefinition were revised back to 1982. Revisions to the estimates of personal income and outlays for 1995 forward are shown in table 6 through 8. Revised and previously published estimates of personal income, disposable personal income, and personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income for 1982 through 1997 are shown in table 9; revisions for 1982 to 1994 reflect only the effect of the redefinition of personal dividend income to exclude capital gains distributions from mutual funds. Personal income was revised down $78.7 billion, or 1.3 percent, for 1995, $70.0 billion, or 1.1 percent, for 1996, and $89.9 billion, or 1.3 percent, for 1997. For 1995, downward revisions to personal dividend income accounted for about three-fourths of the revision. For 1996 and 1997, downward revisions to personal dividend income, to other labor income, and to personal interest income more than accounted for the revision. Personal tax and nontax payments was revised down $0.1 billion for 1995, up $3.6 billion for 1996, and up $0.3 billion for 1997. Disposable personal income was revised down $78.7 billion for 1995, $73.6 billion for 1996, and $90.1 billion for 1997. Personal outlays was revised down $3.9 billion for 1995, up $7.4 billion for 1996, and up $15.6 billion for 1997. The revisions for all 3 years were primarily due to revisions to PCE. Personal saving and personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income was revised down beginning with 1982, reflecting the redefinition of personal dividend income. Revisions to personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income ranged from 0.1 percent for 1982 to 1.8 percent for 1997."

Personal tax and nontax payments increased $2.3 billion in September, compared with an increase of $10.7 billion in August. Disposable personal income (DPI) — personal income less personal tax and nontax payments — increased $9.7 billion, or 0.2 percent, in September, compared with an increase of $19.0 billion, or 0.3 percent, in August. Personal outlays — PCE, interest paid by persons, and personal transfer payments to the rest of the world (net) — increased $32.7 billion in September, compared with an increase of $26.9 billion in August. PCE increased $31.9 billion, compared with an increase of $25.4 billion. Personal saving — DPI less personal outlays — was a negative $12.0 billion in September, in contrast to a positive $11.0 billion in August. The negative personal saving reflects personal outlays that exceed disposable personal income. Negative personal saving, or dissaving, may occur when outlays are financed by borrowing — including borrowing through credit cards or home equity loans — selling investments or other assets, or by using savings from previous periods. Personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income was a negative 0.2 percent in September, in contrast to a positive 0.2 percent in August.

The estimates reflect a comprehensive revision of the national income and product accounts released on October 28, 1999. Revised annual estimates cover 1996–98 and revised monthly estimates span January 1997 through August 1999. The revision includes definitional and statistical changes. Government employee retirement plan treatment was revised, increasing other labor income, interest and dividend income, and reducing personal contributions for social insurance and transfer payments, resulting in higher personal income, DPI, and personal saving across all years. The treatment of noninsured private pension plans was also revised, affecting dividend, rental, and interest income with no net change in personal income or saving. The treatment of estate and gift taxes was revised, lowering personal tax payments and raising DPI, saving, and the saving rate. Improved estimation methods lowered rental income and farm proprietors' income while increasing nonfarm proprietors' income. Incorporation of new Bureau of Labor Statistics data for 1998 also affected components of personal income."

      "text": "In the fourth quarter of 2006, the U.S. economy experienced steady growth in personal income and consumer spending, despite signs of weakening momentum in real income gains. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal income rose by $60.6 billion (0.5%) in December, accelerating from the $32.4 billion (0.3%) increase recorded in November. Disposable personal income (DPI), which subtracts personal taxes from personal income, increased by $50.8 billion (0.5%), also up from the previous month’s 0.3% growth. This growth in income coincided with a robust 0.7% rise in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), a monthly increase of $67.1 billion.\n\nWage growth was particularly strong in December, with private wage and salary disbursements increasing $36.7 billion, nearly double the $19.6 billion gain in November. Most of this was driven by service-producing industries, which saw payrolls expand by $32.4 billion. Goods-producing industries contributed $4.3 billion, while manufacturing payrolls reversed course, increasing $1.8 billion after a November decline. Government wages also added $2.7 billion.\n\nOther components of personal income showed mixed results. Supplements to wages and salaries (e.g., employer contributions to pensions and insurance) rose by $6.8 billion. Proprietors’ income was nearly unchanged, with a $3.1 billion increase in nonfarm income offsetting a $3.1 billion drop in farm income. Rental income of persons declined $2.2 billion, continuing a trend from November. Income from assets (interest and dividends) added $3.2 billion.\n\nA key factor in December’s income jump was the $19.0 billion increase in personal current transfer receipts, compared to a modest $3.3 billion gain in November. This was partly due to retroactive Social Security benefit payments totaling $6.7 billion (annual rate) from adjustments in retirees’ earnings bases.\n\nOn the tax side, personal current taxes rose $9.9 billion, higher than November’s $7.0 billion increase. As a result, DPI grew strongly in nominal terms, although real DPI—adjusted for inflation—only rose 0.2%, following a 0.3% increase in November. Similarly, real PCE increased 0.3%, a slowdown from the 0.5% gain in the previous month. Durable goods purchases grew 1.2%, largely due to higher motor vehicle sales. Nondurable goods rose 0.6%, while service consumption was nearly flat.\n\nDespite these gains, personal saving continued to fall. December’s personal saving was a negative $116.6 billion, compared to a negative $99.2 billion in November. The saving rate dropped to -1.2%, a sign that consumer spending continued to outpace income growth, likely fueled by borrowing or asset liquidation. The PCE price index rose 0.4% in December, up from less than 0.1% in November, largely due to higher energy prices. Core inflation (excluding food and energy) was subdued at 0.1%.\n\nOn an annual basis, personal income grew 6.4% in 2006, up from 5.2% in 2005. DPI increased 5.5% (vs. 4.1% in 2005), while PCE rose 6.0%, slightly below the 6.5% gain the year before. In real terms, DPI increased 2.7% (vs. 1.2% in 2005) and real PCE grew 3.2% (vs. 3.5% in 2005), indicating improving but uneven inflation-adjusted purchasing power. Revisions for October and November were modest, slightly reducing previously published income and spending figures.\n\nOverall, Q4 2006 closed with a strong nominal finish, bolstered by wage gains and transfer payments, but tempered by slowing real consumption and a deepening negative saving rate, pointing to potential challenges in household financial sustainability entering 2007."

      "text": "In the first quarter of 2007, U.S. personal income growth remained solid, though consumer spending began to show signs of deceleration. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal income increased $79.9 billion (0.7%) in March, closely matching the 0.7% gain observed in February. Disposable personal income (DPI)—income after taxes—also grew by 0.7% in March, amounting to a $65.5 billion increase. However, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose more modestly by 0.3%, or $24.4 billion, following a robust 0.7% increase in February. In real terms, which adjust for inflation, DPI increased by 0.2% in both February and March, while real PCE actually declined by 0.2% in March, signaling a potential cooling in consumer demand.\n\nThe March wage data showed steady gains. Private wage and salary disbursements rose $38.3 billion, up from $25.3 billion in February. While this was down from the $66.3 billion increase in January, it's important to note that January’s figure included a $50 billion annualized adjustment for unusually large year-end bonuses and exercised stock options—events not captured by standard monthly reporting. Goods-producing payrolls rose $11.5 billion in March, a sharp acceleration from February’s $1.5 billion. Manufacturing contributed $5.7 billion of that increase. Services-producing industries also grew substantially, adding $26.8 billion in March. Meanwhile, government wage and salary disbursements rose $3.2 billion, compared to $4.4 billion in February.\n\nOther income components presented a mixed picture. Supplements to wages and salaries increased $5.2 billion, and rental income rose by $2.2 billion. Proprietors’ income was flat overall, with farm proprietors’ income rising $3.4 billion and nonfarm proprietors’ income falling $0.9 billion. Personal income receipts on assets—interest and dividend income—grew by $19.8 billion in March, slightly ahead of February’s $18.9 billion increase. Transfer receipts increased $14.4 billion, buoyed in part by ongoing entitlement disbursements.\n\nOn the tax front, personal current taxes increased by $14.4 billion, following a $12.5 billion rise in February. After subtracting taxes, the resulting growth in DPI kept pace with February's upwardly revised performance. However, outlays continued to exceed income. Personal outlays—consisting of PCE, personal interest payments, and personal current transfer payments—grew $25.9 billion in March. That was a steep drop from February’s $70.9 billion increase. Within this, PCE alone rose $24.4 billion in March compared to $69.2 billion in February.\n\nThe result of this imbalance was a continuing trend of negative personal saving. In March, the saving shortfall was $79.3 billion, compared to a $118.8 billion deficit in February. As a percentage of DPI, the personal saving rate stood at -0.8% in March, an improvement over February’s -1.2% but still negative. This persistent negative saving underscores household reliance on borrowing or asset liquidation to sustain consumption levels.\n\nIn real terms, March saw a divergence between income and spending. While real DPI rose 0.2%, real PCE fell 0.2%. Within PCE, purchases of durable goods increased 0.1% following a decline of 0.4% in February. Nondurable goods purchases fell 0.1%, while service consumption declined 0.3%, reversing a 0.6% gain in February. The PCE price index, which deflates these figures, rose 0.4% in March—unchanged from February—while the core index excluding food and energy was nearly flat, rising less than 0.1%.\n\nBEA also released revisions to January and February data. January’s personal income growth was revised up to 1.1% from 1.0%, and February’s to 0.7% from 0.6%. Similar upward adjustments were made to DPI and PCE figures. Real chained-dollar PCE for February was revised to a 0.3% increase, up from 0.2%, and for January to 0.4% from 0.3%, indicating slightly stronger consumer activity than initially reported.\n\nIn summary, Q1 2007 closed with healthy income gains but with softening consumer spending in real terms and continued negative saving. These dynamics, coupled with moderating growth in services and nondurables, may be early signals of growing household caution in the face of inflationary pressures and rising debt levels."

      "text": "In the second quarter of 2007, personal income growth in the United States remained steady, though consumption began to ease. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal income increased $51.7 billion in June, or 0.4%, while disposable personal income (DPI) rose $42.1 billion, also 0.4%. This mirrored May’s pace, which also saw 0.4% growth in both income and DPI. However, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) in June increased by just $11.1 billion, or 0.1%, a significant slowdown compared to May’s $62.5 billion (0.6%) increase. In real terms, DPI rose 0.3% in June after falling 0.1% in May, while real PCE was essentially flat in June after a 0.2% gain in May.\n\nWage and salary disbursements, which form the backbone of personal income, strengthened slightly. Private wages rose $29.1 billion in June, up from a $23.4 billion gain in May. Within this, goods-producing industries added $5.1 billion, with manufacturing payrolls up $3.5 billion. Services-producing industries accounted for $23.9 billion of the increase. Government payrolls also contributed, increasing by $4.7 billion, up from $3.7 billion in May.\n\nOther components of income also contributed moderately. Supplements to wages and salaries grew $5.7 billion, while proprietors' income increased $3.8 billion. Notably, farm income fell by $0.9 billion in June, continuing its decline from May. Rental income of persons rose $3.0 billion, and personal income receipts on assets (interest and dividends) increased $8.8 billion. However, personal current transfer receipts—such as Social Security and Medicare—saw a subdued increase of $0.6 billion, down sharply from the $8.2 billion gain in May.\n\nTaxes rose moderately, with personal current taxes up $9.7 billion in June. As a result, DPI growth was consistent with prior months, rising 0.4% for the second straight month. On the expenditure side, personal outlays increased $16.4 billion in June, substantially lower than the $67.9 billion rise in May. The bulk of this difference came from a sharp slowdown in PCE growth—from $62.5 billion in May to just $11.1 billion in June.\n\nPersonal saving increased notably. DPI exceeded outlays by $64.0 billion in June, compared to $38.5 billion in May. The personal saving rate improved to 0.6% in June, up from 0.4% the previous month. Though still low by historical standards, this shift suggests a modest improvement in household financial buffers.\n\nReal PCE showed a mixed picture: while it was flat overall in June, the underlying components diverged. Durable goods spending fell 1.6%, reversing a 1.7% gain in May. Nondurable goods spending rose marginally, and services rose by 0.2%. The PCE price index decelerated, rising just 0.1% in June compared to 0.5% in May. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, also came in at 0.1%.\n\nThe June report included annual revisions to the national income and product accounts. These revisions impacted data from 2004 to 2006, slightly raising estimates of income and saving. For example, personal income for 2006 was revised upward by $92.2 billion, or 0.8%, and the personal saving rate for that year was revised up from -1.0% to 0.4%. These adjustments, though modest in scale, reflect the incorporation of more comprehensive source data and improved methodologies.\n\nOverall, the second quarter closed with consistent income growth but signs of softening in consumer demand, especially in durable goods. Households began to save slightly more, possibly in response to weakening real spending power and slowing asset growth. The deceleration in PCE and inflation suggests caution among consumers as economic conditions evolve."

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal income rose $47.4 billion, or 0.4%, in September—matching the pace recorded in both August and June. Disposable personal income (DPI) increased by $40.6 billion, or 0.4%, in September, following a stronger 0.5% gain in August. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE), meanwhile, grew by $30.1 billion, or 0.3%, in September, a slowdown from the $51.4 billion (0.5%) increase in August.\n\nThe bulk of September’s personal income gain came from wages and salaries, particularly in the service sector. Private wage and salary disbursements rose by $33.4 billion, more than double the $17.0 billion increase in August. Services-producing industries added $31.5 billion to payrolls, while goods-producing industries contributed a more modest $2.0 billion. Manufacturing payrolls rose only slightly by $0.3 billion. Government wage and salary disbursements grew $4.5 billion, down from a $5.8 billion increase in the prior month.\n\nOther components of income displayed mixed results. Supplements to wages and salaries grew by $5.8 billion, up from $4.8 billion in August. However, proprietors’ income declined sharply, falling $7.1 billion in September after a smaller $0.4 billion dip in August. The decline was driven by a $9.6 billion fall in nonfarm proprietors’ income, only partially offset by a $2.5 billion increase in farm income. Rental income of persons increased by $1.4 billion, while income receipts on assets rose $13.6 billion. Personal current transfer receipts posted a modest increase of $0.7 billion, significantly below the $13.2 billion gain in August.\n\nOn the tax side, personal current taxes increased $6.8 billion in September, a step up from the $4.2 billion increase in August. Consequently, DPI growth moderated to 0.4%, after peaking at 0.6% in July and 0.5% in August. On the expenditure side, personal outlays rose by $33.0 billion in September, easing from $54.3 billion in August. The core driver, PCE, increased $30.1 billion, compared with $51.4 billion the month prior.\n\nPersonal saving rebounded modestly. DPI exceeded outlays by $89.7 billion in September, up from $82.1 billion in August. The personal saving rate edged up to 0.9%, from 0.8% in the previous month. While still historically low, this represents a modest improvement in household financial buffers. \n\nIn real terms, DPI—adjusted for inflation—increased by 0.2% in September, following a 0.5% rise in August. Real PCE rose by just 0.1%, compared to a 0.6% increase in August. Durable goods purchases were up 0.4% after a strong 2.9% surge the prior month, while nondurable goods rose 0.3%. However, real spending on services declined 0.1%, reversing a 0.5% gain in August. \n\nThe PCE price index rose 0.2% in September, compared to a slight decline in August. Excluding food and energy, core PCE inflation also rose 0.2% in September, up from a 0.1% gain in August.\n\nThe BEA also revised July and August figures, with slight upward adjustments to income and consumption components. For example, personal income in August was revised upward to a $52.8 billion increase (0.4%), from a previously reported $40.2 billion (0.3%). Similarly, real chained-dollar DPI and PCE figures for both July and August were modestly revised, showing slightly stronger real income and spending than initially estimated.\n\nOverall, the third quarter of 2007 concluded with steady income gains and moderate consumption growth. However, the slowdown in proprietors’ income and softening in real consumption, particularly in services, signal potential headwinds as economic uncertainty began to rise leading into the final quarter of the year."

In December, personal income rose by $55.1 billion (0.5%), following a $47.6 billion (0.4%) increase in November. Disposable personal income (DPI) grew by $47.5 billion (0.5%) in December, also up from the previous month’s $37.6 billion gain (0.4%). However, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) decelerated sharply to just $23.5 billion (0.2%) in December from $94.6 billion (1.0%) in November.\n\nThe December wage and salary growth was subdued. Private wage and salary disbursements increased $21.4 billion, slowing from a $34.5 billion increase in November. Goods-producing industries shed $1.4 billion in payrolls, driven by a $2.0 billion drop in manufacturing wages, while services-producing industries added $22.8 billion—down from $27.7 billion the prior month. Government wages rose $3.7 billion, slightly lower than November’s $4.0 billion gain.\n\nOther components of income were mixed. Supplements to wages and salaries increased $4.8 billion in December, down from $5.9 billion in November. Proprietors' income remained flat overall, as a $2.9 billion increase in farm income was offset by a $2.8 billion decrease in nonfarm income. Rental income of persons rose $2.9 billion, matching November’s growth. Personal income receipts on assets (interest and dividends) edged up by $3.1 billion, slightly below November’s $3.3 billion increase.\n\nA standout component in December was the $22.0 billion increase in personal current transfer receipts, reversing an $8.9 billion drop in November. This jump was attributed primarily to a rise in Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit payments—following a temporary reduction in November due to the annual reconciliation process—and retroactive Social Security benefit adjustments of $7.0 billion.\n\nContributions for government social insurance rose $3.2 billion in December, slower than the $5.0 billion rise in November. Personal current taxes increased by $7.6 billion, resulting in a net DPI gain of $47.5 billion, slightly stronger than the prior month.\n\nIn terms of consumer activity, personal outlays increased $19.7 billion in December, sharply lower than November’s $90.7 billion increase. PCE alone rose $23.5 billion in December, down substantially from the $94.6 billion surge in November, suggesting a cooling in household spending at year-end.\n\nAs a result of restrained consumption, personal saving rebounded. In December, personal saving reached $26.0 billion, a reversal from negative $1.8 billion in November. The personal saving rate increased to 0.2% from 0.0% the previous month.\n\nOn a real basis, inflation-adjusted DPI rose by 0.2% in December, recovering from a 0.2% decline in November. Real PCE, however, fell slightly by less than 0.1%, after increasing 0.4% the prior month. Within real PCE, durable goods purchases declined 0.3%, nondurables fell 0.2%, while services ticked up 0.1%.\n\nThe PCE price index rose 0.2% in December, down from 0.6% in November. Core inflation (excluding food and energy) held steady at 0.2%.\n\nLooking at 2007 as a whole, personal income grew by 6.2%, a slight deceleration from 6.6% in 2006. DPI rose by 5.8%, compared with 5.9% the previous year. Total PCE increased by 5.5%, down from 5.9% in 2006. After adjusting for inflation, real DPI held steady at 3.1% growth, while real PCE slowed slightly to 2.9% from 3.1% in 2006.\n\nRevisions to prior months affected the narrative slightly. October personal income was revised up from $24.8 billion to $25.3 billion (0.2%), and November from $43.1 billion to $47.6 billion (0.4%). Similarly, October and November DPI and PCE were revised modestly upward. Notably, real PCE for October was revised from +0.1% to -0.1%, and November from +0.5% to +0.4%, indicating some underlying weakness in inflation-adjusted spending.\n\nOverall, the fourth quarter of 2007 reflected steady income gains, a marked slowdown in spending, and a brief recovery in household saving—occurring amid broader signs of an economic cooling ahead of the 2008 downturn."

Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) grew by $42.9 billion (0.4%), a notable acceleration from the $11.0 billion (0.1%) increase recorded in February.\n\nReal disposable income, adjusted for inflation, edged down by less than 0.1% in March, reversing the 0.3% increase in February. Real PCE, meanwhile, rose by 0.1% in March, after dipping slightly in February. Despite nominal increases in income and spending, the real figures highlight the constraining effects of inflation in early 2008.\n\nWages and salaries were the main contributor to March’s income growth, with private disbursements rising $26.1 billion, up from $17.3 billion in February. Goods-producing payrolls gained $4.8 billion, while manufacturing accounted for $2.4 billion of that. Services-producing industries added $21.3 billion to payrolls, while government wage disbursements rose $3.6 billion, a slowdown from February’s $5.3 billion.\n\nOther components of personal income presented mixed results. Supplements to wages and salaries rose by $5.9 billion, almost flat compared to February. Proprietors’ income declined for a second month, falling $4.9 billion, with farm income down $3.2 billion and nonfarm income down $1.6 billion. Rental income fell by $1.0 billion. Asset-based income (interest and dividends) added $4.9 billion, slightly less than February’s $5.3 billion gain.\n\nPersonal current transfer receipts, which include government benefits such as Social Security and Medicare, increased $8.1 billion in March—down from the sharp $36.0 billion increase in February. This variation continues to reflect adjustments in Medicare Part D payments, which had been reduced in January to recover overpayments from 2006.\n\nContributions for government social insurance—subtracted in calculating personal income—increased by $3.9 billion, slightly higher than the $3.0 billion increase in February.\n\nPersonal current taxes rose by $9.2 billion in March, leading to a slower net increase in DPI ($29.6 billion) compared with February’s $50.3 billion.\n\nOn the consumption side, personal outlays—including PCE, interest payments, and transfer payments—rose by $42.1 billion, up sharply from February’s $10.4 billion. This surge was largely driven by the $42.9 billion increase in PCE.\n\nAs a result, personal saving declined in March. The saving level dropped to $25.2 billion, down from $37.7 billion in February. The saving rate slipped to 0.2% from 0.4%, continuing the trend of relatively weak household saving amid rising expenditures.\n\nLooking at real consumption components, real PCE rose 0.1% in March, led by a 0.2% gain in both nondurable goods and services. However, real purchases of durable goods declined 0.5%, reversing the modest 0.1% gain in February. The price index for PCE rose 0.3% in March, up from 0.1% in February, while core PCE inflation (excluding food and energy) increased 0.2%.\n\nRevised estimates for January and February reflect upward adjustments to income and spending levels. Notably, the monthly changes in chained (2000) dollar DPI and PCE were slightly revised, supporting the view of a modestly stronger real-income environment early in the quarter.\n\nIn summary, March 2008 marked continued nominal income and spending growth, but inflation-adjusted data showed signs of stagnation. With rising prices and declining savings, these figures foreshadow growing economic pressures leading into the financial crisis later that year."

      "text": "In June 2008, personal income rose by a modest $6.8 billion (0.1%), while disposable personal income (DPI) dropped sharply by $210.3 billion (1.9%), according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The decline in DPI follows a massive surge in May, when DPI increased $595.4 billion (5.7%) due to the distribution of rebate payments under the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. These payments were largely responsible for the highly irregular income patterns across the second quarter.\n\nReal disposable income (adjusted for inflation) fell 2.6% in June, reversing the 5.2% increase recorded in May. Similarly, real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) declined by 0.2% in June, after a 0.3% increase the previous month. The drop in real DPI and PCE underscores the waning impact of stimulus payments and the effects of inflationary pressures.\n\nThe June decline in DPI was driven almost entirely by the reduction in government rebate disbursements. After boosting DPI by $553.8 billion in May, the rebates subtracted $242.7 billion from the change in June. Excluding the effects of the rebates, DPI would have grown by $32.4 billion, or 0.3%—a much more stable underlying figure.\n\nOn the wage side, private wage and salary disbursements increased $11.1 billion in June, down from a $17.7 billion increase in May. Government wages added another $5.2 billion. Within private industry, goods-producing payrolls rose by $1.2 billion (with manufacturing up $0.8 billion), while services-producing payrolls rose $9.9 billion. Supplements to wages and salaries grew by $3.1 billion, slowing slightly from May’s $3.6 billion.\n\nOther income components were mixed. Proprietors’ income rose by $6.9 billion, including a $0.5 billion increase in farm income. Rental income grew by $7.7 billion, slightly up from May. However, income from assets (interest and dividends) fell for the second consecutive month, down $4.2 billion.\n\nPersonal current transfer receipts declined by $21.4 billion in June, after a surge of $187.5 billion in May, both changes reflecting timing differences in the stimulus rebate program. Contributions for government social insurance (a subtraction from personal income) rose $1.6 billion.\n\nPersonal current taxes jumped by $217.1 billion in June, following a $376.2 billion decline in May. These fluctuations again reflect the treatment of rebate payments, which reduced reported personal taxes by $397.5 billion in May and $185.0 billion in June. After accounting for these tax effects, the steep decline in DPI in June becomes clearer.\n\nTotal personal outlays—comprising PCE, interest payments, and current transfers—increased $60.8 billion in June, down from $80.2 billion in May. PCE itself accounted for $57.1 billion of the monthly increase.\n\nPersonal saving (DPI minus outlays) dropped to $275.9 billion in June from $547.0 billion in May. As a percentage of DPI, the saving rate fell to 2.5% from 4.9%, reflecting the expiration of the stimulus boost to income. Households turned more to spending than saving as government support receded.\n\nIn terms of real expenditures, durable goods purchases fell by 1.6%, reversing the 0.5% increase in May. Nondurable goods purchases slipped 0.4%, while services spending rose by 0.2%. The PCE price index jumped 0.8% in June, signaling accelerating inflation. Core prices (excluding food and energy) rose by 0.3%.\n\nRevisions to historical NIPA data were also released this month. Personal income was revised down for 2005 and 2007, while a slight upward revision was made for 2006. DPI, PCE, and saving estimates were also updated, with real DPI for 2007 revised down from 3.1% to 2.8%. The saving rate for 2007 was revised up to 0.6%.\n\nIn sum, June 2008 reflected a normalization of household income after the artificial inflation of DPI from federal stimulus checks. While nominal income remained flat and spending growth slowed, real economic activity showed signs of contraction, emphasizing the fragility of household financial conditions heading into the second half of the year."

      "text": "In September 2008, personal income increased by $24.5 billion (0.2%), and disposable personal income (DPI) rose by $25.7 billion (0.2%), according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. However, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) fell by $33.6 billion (0.3%), the largest monthly decline so far that year. This contraction in consumer spending, despite modest income growth, signaled rising caution among households amid worsening economic conditions.\n\nThe impact of Hurricane Ike, which made landfall on September 13, was also reflected in the data. Rental income was reduced by $27 billion and proprietors' income by $9 billion (both at annual rates) due to uninsured property losses. These reductions were partially offset by a $27 billion boost in insurance-related transfer receipts. In total, the hurricane reduced September personal income by an estimated $8.5 billion.\n\nReal DPI (adjusted for inflation) grew 0.1% in September, rebounding from a 1.0% decline in August. Real PCE fell by 0.4%, continuing a trend of weak consumption. Notably, durable goods purchases dropped by 2.9%, largely due to a steep decline in motor vehicle sales. Nondurable goods purchases fell 0.8%, while services increased modestly by 0.2%.\n\nPrivate wage and salary growth stalled in September, increasing just $0.3 billion after a $24.1 billion rise in August. Goods-producing industries saw payrolls fall by $4.0 billion, led by a $2.6 billion decline in manufacturing. Services payrolls added $4.3 billion, and government wages increased by $4.0 billion. Supplements to wages rose only $1.2 billion, down from $3.1 billion the prior month.\n\nProprietors’ income declined again, falling $3.4 billion, with farm income down $3.5 billion. Rental income dropped significantly, down $24.0 billion due to hurricane-related losses. However, asset income (interest and dividends) rose by $9.1 billion, and personal current transfer receipts surged $37.3 billion, buoyed by insurance benefits and extended unemployment compensation under the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008.\n\nPersonal current taxes fell $1.1 billion in September, compared to a $152.4 billion increase in August. Excluding effects from the Economic Stimulus Act, DPI increased by 0.3% in September, suggesting modest but positive income trends.\n\nPersonal outlays declined by $32.0 billion in September, largely due to the drop in PCE. As a result, personal saving increased to $140.3 billion, with the saving rate rising to 1.3% from 0.8% in August. This suggests households were beginning to retrench as financial uncertainty intensified.\n\nThe PCE price index rose 0.1% in September, while the core index (excluding food and energy) increased 0.2%. These moderate price movements contrasted with declining real consumption, indicating stagnating demand pressures.\n\nOverall, the September 2008 data reflect both transitory hurricane effects and deeper structural economic weakness. Despite modest gains in income, consumption fell in real and nominal terms, and the saving rate rose as consumers pulled back on spending. The data foreshadowed the mounting severity of the financial crisis that would intensify in the final quarter of the year."

      "text": "In December 2008, personal income declined by $25.3 billion (−0.2%), following a sharper drop of $44.0 billion in November (−0.4%). Disposable personal income (DPI) also fell by $25.1 billion (−0.2%), capping a quarter marked by continued economic deterioration during the global financial crisis. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) plunged by $102.4 billion (−1.0%), extending the 0.8% decline seen in November.\n\nDespite nominal declines, real disposable income (inflation-adjusted) rose 0.3% in December after a 0.8% increase in November. This real increase stemmed from falling prices: the PCE price index dropped 0.5% in December and 1.1% in November. However, real PCE declined 0.5% in December, reversing a 0.3% increase in the prior month. Households remained hesitant to spend despite the boost in purchasing power.\n\nWage and salary disbursements contracted significantly as private payrolls dropped by $23.5 billion, compared with a $12.1 billion decline in November. Goods-producing industries were hit hardest, with payrolls falling $15.7 billion, including a $9.6 billion loss in manufacturing. Services-producing industries declined by $7.8 billion. Government payrolls provided some stability, rising $2.3 billion.\n\nOther components of personal income also signaled weakness. Proprietors' income declined $6.8 billion, including a $5.9 billion drop in nonfarm proprietors' income. Asset-based income (interest and dividends) continued to fall, dropping by $29.0 billion. These declines reflect the ongoing tightening of credit markets and declining equity values.\n\nPersonal current transfer receipts, however, rose $24.4 billion in December. This was driven by retroactive Social Security payments and expanded unemployment benefits under the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008, which alone added $7.1 billion to transfer receipts. Rental income increased modestly by $4.3 billion.\n\nPersonal current taxes declined slightly by $0.2 billion. Combined with falling income, this resulted in a $25.1 billion decrease in DPI. Personal outlays, including PCE and other household expenses, fell sharply by $104.6 billion. This decline in spending pushed the personal saving rate to 3.6% in December, up from 2.8% in November. Total personal saving rose to $378.6 billion, the highest level in over a year, as consumers cut back in response to economic uncertainty.\n\nOn a real basis, December marked a continued pullback in consumption. Real PCE declined by 0.5%, driven by a 0.8% drop in durable goods purchases and a sharp 1.8% fall in nondurables. Only services showed modest growth (0.1%). These trends reflected heightened caution among households, amid layoffs and falling wealth.\n\nDecember's data closed a quarter of extraordinary economic contraction. From October to December, current-dollar PCE dropped every month, totaling over $280 billion in nominal declines. Real DPI rose each month, but the gains were outpaced by falling consumption, resulting in higher saving. Revisions to prior estimates confirmed weaker income and consumption trends than previously reported.\n\nThe data underscore the severity of the downturn at the end of 2008, with falling labor compensation, collapsing asset income, and plunging spending. While transfer payments and deflation provided some buffer to real income, the consumer retrenchment was stark—signaling a deepening recession ahead."

      "text": "In March 2009, personal income declined by $34.4 billion (−0.3%), continuing the downward trend following a $24.3 billion decline in February (−0.2%). Disposable personal income (DPI) edged down $1.8 billion (less than −0.1%), after a negligible increase of $0.2 billion the previous month. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) fell by $24.2 billion (−0.2%) in March, reversing the 0.4% increase seen in February.\n\nDespite the nominal decline in DPI, real disposable income (adjusted for inflation) increased slightly—by less than 0.1%—following a 0.3% decrease in February. The increase reflected the decline in the PCE price index, which fell less than 0.1% in March. Real PCE, however, contracted by 0.2% in March, in contrast to a modest 0.1% gain in February. Consumers cut back on both durable goods (−0.8%) and nondurables (−0.6%), while services spending grew just 0.1%.\n\nLabor market conditions remained weak. Private wage and salary disbursements fell by $32.9 billion in March, after a $28.8 billion drop in February. Goods-producing payrolls were down $15.3 billion, including a $7.8 billion decline in manufacturing. Services payrolls fell $17.6 billion, continuing a sharp contraction. Government payrolls provided modest offsetting support, rising $2.9 billion.\n\nOther components of income showed further softness. Proprietors’ income decreased by $5.9 billion in March, reversing a $1.9 billion gain in February. The decline was concentrated in nonfarm proprietors' income (−$5.9 billion). Rental income of persons fell $3.3 billion, and income from assets—interest and dividends—continued their descent, declining by $20.7 billion.\n\nTransfer receipts rose by $18.8 billion in March, slightly above the $17.2 billion gain in February, providing some cushion. These increases reflect expansions in unemployment benefits and other automatic stabilizers. At the same time, contributions for government social insurance decreased by $4.4 billion, slightly more than February’s $4.3 billion decline.\n\nPersonal current taxes decreased by $32.7 billion, following a $24.6 billion drop in February. This included the impact of the Making Work Pay Credit provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which reduced personal taxes by $11.2 billion at an annual rate in March.\n\nPersonal outlays, including PCE and household transfer payments, declined by $24.5 billion in March, a reversal from the $38.7 billion increase in February. As a result, personal saving rose to $455.3 billion, up from $432.6 billion the previous month. The saving rate climbed to 4.2% from 4.0%.\n\nOverall, March 2009 closed a tumultuous first quarter marked by steep job losses, weak income growth, and erratic consumer spending. While government policy efforts began to bolster real income and reduce tax burdens, households remained cautious amid widespread economic uncertainty and a contracting labor market."

      "text": "In June 2009, personal income fell sharply by $159.8 billion (−1.3%), and disposable personal income (DPI) dropped $143.8 billion (−1.3%). This reversal followed a strong gain in May when personal income surged $155.1 billion (1.3%) and DPI rose $168.7 billion (1.6%) due to one-time government transfers under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). By contrast, the June figures reflected the unwinding of those payments, with fewer stimulus disbursements driving down transfer receipts.\n\nExcluding the ARRA-related transfer receipts, personal income declined only $7.8 billion (−0.1%) in June, following a smaller $2.5 billion drop in May. Real DPI, adjusted for inflation, fell 1.8% in June after rising 1.5% in May, while real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) dipped 0.1%, marking a subtle slowdown in inflation-adjusted spending momentum.\n\nWages and salaries contracted substantially. Private payrolls fell by $28.6 billion, driven by a $17.5 billion drop in services-producing industries and an $11.1 billion decline in goods-producing industries. Manufacturing payrolls alone were down $6.7 billion. Government wages increased modestly by $2.8 billion, compared to $4.3 billion in May.\n\nOther income components also weakened. Supplements to wages and salaries edged down $0.3 billion. Proprietors’ income declined $1.0 billion, with farm income decreasing $0.9 billion and nonfarm income down $0.2 billion. Asset-based income (interest and dividends) dropped $7.3 billion, matching May’s decline. Rental income rose $2.8 billion, following a $3.2 billion gain previously.\n\nTransfer receipts, a major driver of May’s spike in DPI, plummeted by $131.7 billion in June. The decline came after May's temporary $250 stimulus payments to Social Security and disability beneficiaries. In June, only a smaller set of $250 payments to veterans was distributed, boosting transfers by a more modest $5.6 billion.\n\nPersonal current taxes declined by $16.0 billion, larger than May’s $13.6 billion decrease. However, this tax relief could not offset the loss in income from expiring stimulus support, resulting in the overall decline in DPI. Meanwhile, personal outlays grew $32.4 billion in June, driven by a $41.4 billion rise in PCE. This sharp spending increase against falling income led to a drop in the personal saving rate—from 6.2% in May to 4.6% in June. Total personal saving declined from $681.0 billion to $504.8 billion.\n\nReal PCE showed mixed patterns: durable goods purchases declined 0.2% after a 1.2% increase in May, largely due to reduced auto sales. Nondurable goods fell 0.4%, while services spending was nearly flat. Inflation picked up slightly; the PCE price index rose 0.5% in June after a 0.1% increase in May. The core index (excluding food and energy) rose 0.2%, up from 0.1% in the prior month.\n\nThis release also incorporated comprehensive revisions to the national income and product accounts, revising personal income, DPI, and PCE back to 1929. The revisions had notable effects for 2006–2008, including upward adjustments to wages, rental income, and interest income, but downward revisions to dividends and taxes. These changes lifted the estimated saving rate over the three-year period.\n\nOverall, June 2009 captured the transition from stimulus-driven income support to a resumption of recessionary income declines. While spending rebounded modestly, the expiration of one-time transfers exposed the underlying weakness in wage income and private sector earnings."

These flat figures followed modest gains in August, when income rose $17.4 billion and DPI grew $14.1 billion (both +0.1%). Meanwhile, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) dropped sharply by $47.2 billion (−0.5%) in September, following a $139.8 billion (1.4%) surge in August.\n\nReal disposable income (adjusted for inflation) fell 0.1% in September, a slightly slower decline than the 0.2% decrease in August. Real PCE dropped 0.6% in September, reversing a strong 1.0% increase the prior month. The sharp pullback in consumption was driven by the expiration of the federal 'Cash for Clunkers' program, which had boosted durable goods sales, especially motor vehicles, in August.\n\nWage and salary disbursements declined by $11.2 billion in September after increasing $10.1 billion in August. Goods-producing industries saw payrolls shrink by $7.8 billion (including a $1.5 billion decline in manufacturing), while services-producing industries fell $3.4 billion, reversing a $16.4 billion increase. Government payrolls edged up just $0.2 billion after a $2.4 billion gain.\n\nOther components of personal income were mixed. Supplements to wages and salaries rose a modest $0.1 billion, much lower than August’s $2.0 billion gain. Proprietors’ income increased $0.7 billion, mainly from nonfarm businesses (+$2.3 billion), while farm income dropped $1.6 billion. Rental income increased $5.4 billion, similar to the prior month. Personal income receipts on assets continued their steep decline, falling $13.8 billion for a second straight month.\n\nPersonal current transfer receipts rose $17.3 billion in September, reflecting continued support from programs like unemployment insurance and Social Security. Contributions for government social insurance declined $1.4 billion, helping to cushion the net decrease in income.\n\nPersonal current taxes edged up $0.1 billion, leading to the small net decline in DPI. On the spending side, personal outlays fell by $48.8 billion in September, reversing a $138.2 billion surge in August. With income steady and spending falling, personal saving rose from $307.0 billion in August to $355.6 billion in September. The personal saving rate climbed to 3.3%, up from 2.8%.\n\nInflation remained subdued. The PCE price index increased 0.1% in September, after a 0.3% rise in August. Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.1%, the same rate as the previous month.\n\nThe September data highlighted a normalization in consumer behavior after government stimulus programs boosted economic activity earlier in the quarter. The end of the CARS program had a clear impact: real durable goods purchases fell 7.2% in September, after rising 6.7% in August. Purchases of nondurable goods rose 0.5%, while services rose just 0.1%.\n\nOverall, the third quarter closed with signs of stabilization in incomes but a cooling in consumer demand, as temporary stimulus effects faded. The economy was still fragile, with households cautious and saving more despite historically low interest rates and government support."

Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) also rose, but more modestly, increasing by $22.6 billion (0.2%) compared to a larger $69.1 billion (0.7%) gain in November.\n\nInflation-adjusted income and spending continued to show positive growth. Real DPI increased by 0.3% in December, matching the prior month's gain. Real PCE rose by just 0.1%, however, a deceleration from November’s 0.4% increase. The slower pace of consumption reflected cautious household behavior heading into the new year.\n\nWages and salaries were a mixed picture. Private wage and salary disbursements increased by just $6.3 billion in December, significantly below November’s $25.1 billion rise. Goods-producing industries saw payrolls fall by $5.2 billion, reversing a $2.9 billion increase. Within that, manufacturing payrolls dropped $2.2 billion. Services-producing payrolls rose $11.5 billion, down from a $22.3 billion gain. Government wages edged up $2.9 billion, slightly more than November’s $1.8 billion.\n\nOther components of income provided more consistent support. Proprietors’ income rose $8.9 billion in December, following a $12.8 billion increase in November. Farm income grew by $7.0 billion, mirroring the previous month, while nonfarm proprietors’ income added $1.9 billion. Rental income and asset income (interest and dividends) both posted steady gains of $2.0 billion and $10.1 billion, respectively.\n\nPersonal current transfer receipts rose by $14.0 billion, up from $9.8 billion in November. A major contributor was a $8.5 billion increase in Social Security benefit payments due to a recalculation of the earnings base for recent retirees. These transfers helped offset weaker wage growth.\n\nTaxes fell slightly: personal current taxes decreased $1.4 billion in December after increasing $0.3 billion in November. With income up and taxes down, DPI increased $45.9 billion. On the spending side, personal outlays increased by $18.0 billion, largely driven by PCE. As a result, personal saving rose to $534.2 billion in December from $506.3 billion in November. The saving rate climbed to 4.8%, up from 4.5%.\n\nIn real terms, consumer spending was tepid. Real PCE rose just 0.1%, supported by a 0.2% increase in durable goods spending. However, nondurable goods spending fell by 0.8%, and services rose a modest 0.4%. Price inflation remained subdued: the PCE price index rose just 0.1% in December, while the core index (excluding food and energy) also rose 0.1%.\n\nRevisions to October and November data indicated modest upgrades in prior estimates. November’s personal income gain was revised up to $61.1 billion (0.5%) from $49.7 billion (0.4%), and PCE was revised up to 0.7% from 0.5%. Despite these revisions, December’s data capped a quarter of modest but broad-based improvement in household financial conditions as the U.S. emerged slowly from recession."

Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose more sharply in March, increasing by $58.6 billion (0.6%) after a similar $56.4 billion (0.5%) gain in February.\n\nInflation-adjusted measures showed steady real income growth and a moderate acceleration in spending. Real DPI increased 0.2% in March (after a flat reading in February), while real PCE rose 0.5%, matching February’s growth. These gains suggest a gradual return to consumer confidence in early 2010 following the deep recession.\n\nWage and salary disbursements rose by $11.8 billion in March, compared with a $6.8 billion increase in February. Goods-producing industries rebounded, posting a $2.2 billion increase in March after a $3.3 billion decline in February. Manufacturing payrolls were up $0.3 billion, reversing a $1.1 billion fall. Services-producing payrolls added $9.6 billion, slightly below the previous month’s gain. Government payrolls rose $1.8 billion, up from $0.9 billion.\n\nOther sources of income showed mixed results. Proprietors’ income rose $2.7 billion overall, with nonfarm income up $7.9 billion, offsetting a $5.2 billion drop in farm income. Rental income increased $1.9 billion. Asset-based income (interest and dividends) declined by $8.3 billion, continuing a trend of weakness in capital income. Personal current transfer receipts, however, jumped $24.9 billion, including a $12.0 billion boost (at an annual rate) from emergency unemployment compensation programs.\n\nPersonal current taxes rose $3.7 billion in March, following a $2.8 billion increase in February. Net of taxes, DPI grew by $32.3 billion. Meanwhile, personal outlays (including PCE and other spending) increased by $60.6 billion, slightly above February’s $58.3 billion gain. This meant that despite higher income, the personal saving rate declined: savings dropped to $304.0 billion in March from $332.2 billion in February, and the saving rate fell to 2.7% from 3.0%.\n\nOn a real basis, March’s consumption growth was driven by durable goods, which surged 3.4% after a 1.0% rise in February—largely due to higher motor vehicle purchases. Nondurable goods rose 0.4%, slightly down from 0.7% the prior month, while services spending barely budged, increasing less than 0.1%.\n\nThe PCE price index increased 0.1% in March, reflecting modest inflation. The core PCE index (excluding food and energy) also rose 0.1%, consistent with tame price pressures during the recovery.\n\nRevisions to January and February estimates showed stronger-than-initially-reported income growth in both months. February’s personal income was revised up from $1.2 billion to $7.1 billion, and January’s income from $30.4 billion to $48.0 billion. PCE for February was also revised significantly upward, reflecting more robust household spending early in the year.

Goods-producing industries saw a sharp $8.9 billion drop in payrolls, including a $6.0 billion decline in manufacturing. Services-producing payrolls increased $3.7 billion, while government payrolls fell $0.6 billion, largely due to the release of temporary Census 2010 workers.\n\nOther income components were mixed.

The personal saving rate for 2009 was revised upward to 5.9%. These revisions reflect more complete source data and improve the historical picture of household finances during the recession and its aftermath.\n\nOverall, June 2010 data pointed to a loss of momentum in the recovery, with weaker payroll growth, falling proprietors’ income, and tepid consumption. Still, steady real income gains and elevated savings suggested households remained cautious but financially stable."

      "text": "In December 2010, personal income rose by $54.5 billion (0.4%), continuing the steady monthly gains seen through the fourth quarter. Disposable personal income (DPI) also increased by $47.3 billion (0.4%), while personal consumption expenditures (PCE) jumped $69.5 billion (0.7%), indicating stronger household demand heading into the new year.\n\nInflation-adjusted figures showed more modest gains. Real DPI rose 0.1% in December, down from 0.2% in November. Real PCE, however, accelerated to 0.4% growth, doubling the prior month’s pace. The increase in real PCE reflected broad-based gains across spending categories: durable goods purchases rose 1.0%, nondurables rose 0.3%, and services climbed 0.3%.\n\nWage and salary disbursements strengthened, increasing $15.5 billion in December compared with a $5.9 billion rise in November. Services-producing industries led the way with a $14.0 billion gain, while goods-producing industries rebounded from losses the prior month. Manufacturing payrolls turned positive, rising $0.2 billion after falling $2.5 billion in November.\n\nOther components of income were also supportive. Proprietors' income rose $8.1 billion, rental income increased $1.9 billion, and income from assets (interest and dividends) surged by $21.9 billion—one of the largest increases in over a year. Personal current transfer receipts, including Social Security and unemployment benefits, rose $3.8 billion.\n\nDespite strong income and asset gains, taxes also rose, with personal current taxes increasing by $7.1 billion. Nonetheless, the net gain in DPI supported additional consumer spending. Outlays rose by $67.5 billion, mostly from PCE. As a result, personal saving declined slightly to $614.1 billion, and the saving rate ticked down to 5.3% from 5.5% in November.\n\nInflation showed signs of acceleration. The PCE price index rose 0.3% in December, compared with 0.1% in November, while the core PCE index (excluding food and energy) increased by less than 0.1%, consistent with the Federal Reserve’s view of subdued underlying inflation.\n\nOverall, the December report capped off a relatively strong fourth quarter for consumer activity. Rising wages, improving asset income, and robust spending suggest momentum entering 2011, although higher prices and modest real income growth could pose headwinds for future consumption growth."

      "text": "In March 2011, personal income rose by $67.0 billion (0.5%), while disposable personal income (DPI) increased by $64.4 billion (0.6%), according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) also increased by $60.7 billion (0.6%), reflecting continued consumer spending strength in early 2011.\n\nAfter adjusting for inflation, real DPI grew modestly by 0.1%, following a gain of less than 0.1% in February. Real PCE rose 0.2% in March, a deceleration from February’s 0.5% increase. This cooling in consumption growth was largely attributed to slower growth in durable goods purchases (0.1% in March vs. 1.9% in February) and a decline in nondurable goods spending (−0.3%), though services spending remained steady, rising 0.4%.\n\nThe income gains were driven in part by a $18.0 billion increase in private wages and salaries, including a notable $5.1 billion rise in manufacturing payrolls. Services-producing industries added $11.8 billion, while government payrolls rose $1.2 billion, rebounding from a slight decline the prior month. Supplements to wages and salaries rose $4.0 billion.\n\nOther components also contributed to income growth. Rental income surged by $8.7 billion, and personal income receipts on assets (interest and dividends) increased $8.9 billion. Proprietors' income was up $4.4 billion, with farm income contributing $1.6 billion and nonfarm income adding $2.9 billion. Transfer receipts posted a strong $24.7 billion increase, driven by scheduled benefits such as Social Security and unemployment insurance.\n\nOn the tax side, personal current taxes rose $2.5 billion, slightly less than February’s $3.6 billion increase. The net result was a 0.6% gain in DPI, which enabled households to maintain consumption levels while slightly increasing their savings. Total personal outlays matched the PCE rise at $60.7 billion, resulting in a slight increase in personal saving to $651.2 billion. The personal saving rate held steady at 5.5%.\n\nPrice pressures picked up slightly in March. The PCE price index increased 0.4%, unchanged from February, while the core PCE index (excluding food and energy) rose 0.1%, suggesting that most of the price acceleration was concentrated in volatile categories.\n\nOverall, the March data capped a solid first quarter of 2011, characterized by steady income gains, sustained consumer demand, and manageable inflation. However, the softening in real consumption growth and a small drop in nondurable spending may signal a cautious outlook among consumers as energy prices rise and the effects of earlier fiscal stimulus measures fade."

In contrast, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) declined by $21.9 billion (−0.2%), marking the second consecutive monthly decline in real PCE. These shifts indicate growing caution among consumers amid weak wage growth and fiscal policy uncertainty.\n\nReal DPI (inflation-adjusted) rose by 0.3% in June, a recovery from the slight decline in May. However, real PCE decreased marginally (less than 0.1%), following a −0.1% drop in May. Notably, spending on durable goods fell by 0.6%—driven largely by decreased purchases of motor vehicles and parts—while nondurable goods spending increased 0.2%. Services consumption ticked down slightly.\n\nWage and salary disbursements declined by $2.2 billion, reversing May’s $15.0 billion increase. Goods-producing industries were hardest hit, with payrolls falling by $1.8 billion; manufacturing declined by $2.1 billion. Services industries were nearly flat (−$0.3 billion), while government payrolls fell for a second month (−$0.4 billion).\n\nOther income components were mixed. Proprietors’ income declined $0.8 billion after a slight gain in May. Rental income of persons also decreased by $1.2 billion. Meanwhile, personal income receipts on assets increased by $12.0 billion, and personal current transfer receipts grew by $9.5 billion, partly due to legislative changes in unemployment compensation.\n\nPersonal current taxes rose $2.3 billion, leaving DPI with a net gain of $16.3 billion. On the spending side, total personal outlays dropped $22.6 billion due to the decline in PCE. As a result, personal saving increased to $620.6 billion, and the saving rate climbed to 5.4%, up from 5.0% in May.\n\nPrice pressures softened: the PCE price index fell 0.2% in June, compared to a 0.2% increase in May. Excluding food and energy, prices rose a modest 0.1%, suggesting inflation was well-contained.\n\nOverall, the data from June 2011 reflect tepid income growth and a pullback in consumer spending, despite stronger real purchasing power. This hesitancy was likely due to uncertainty around labor market strength and broader macroeconomic headwinds. The rise in savings also points to increased precautionary behavior by households."

In contrast, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) surged by $68.7 billion (0.6%), indicating a strong rebound in consumer spending. This followed a weak August, where both personal income and DPI declined by 0.1% and PCE increased only 0.2%.\n\nDespite nominal income gains, real disposable income (adjusted for inflation) fell 0.1% in September, continuing a downward trend from August (−0.4%). However, real PCE grew by 0.5%, rebounding from a flat performance the previous month. The primary driver was a 2.6% increase in durable goods purchases—particularly motor vehicles and parts, which had contracted in August due to supply disruptions. Nondurable goods consumption rose by 0.5%, while services spending edged up by 0.1%.\n\nThe wage and salary component of income improved, with private disbursements increasing $17.9 billion in September after a $9.8 billion decline in August. Services-producing industries contributed $16.3 billion to this growth, while goods-producing industries added $1.6 billion. Manufacturing payrolls, however, decreased by $1.1 billion. Government payrolls declined $0.7 billion.\n\nOther sources of income showed mixed results. Proprietors’ income increased by $2.3 billion, driven by gains in both farm and nonfarm components. Rental income rose by $5.8 billion, while asset-based income (interest and dividends) declined by $9.2 billion, continuing a negative trend. Transfer receipts increased by only $0.6 billion, and contributions to government social insurance rose by $2.2 billion.\n\nPersonal current taxes rose by $4.5 billion in September, partially offsetting income gains and limiting the increase in DPI. Meanwhile, household outlays jumped $72.1 billion due to higher consumption, reducing the personal saving rate to 3.6%, down from 4.1% in August.\n\nInflationary pressures moderated slightly. The PCE price index rose 0.2% in September, down from 0.3% in August. Core PCE (excluding food and energy) declined marginally (less than 0.1%), reflecting easing price increases.\n\nOverall, the September data highlight a resilient rebound in consumer spending, particularly for durable goods, despite continued weakness in real income growth. Households appeared willing to dip into savings to support consumption, but sluggish wage growth and declining asset income posed ongoing constraints."

This marked a sharp improvement from November, when personal income rose just 0.1% and DPI fell slightly. However, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) declined $2.0 billion (less than 0.1%) in December, reversing a modest gain the prior month.\n\nReal DPI (adjusted for inflation) grew 0.3% in December, recovering from a marginal decline in November. In contrast, real PCE slipped by 0.1%, despite earlier momentum, as households cut back on spending across all major categories: durable goods (−0.1%), nondurable goods (−0.1%), and services (−0.1%). This suggests that the income boost did not immediately translate into higher consumption.\n\nThe largest contributor to the rise in income was wage and salary disbursements, which increased by $29.1 billion. This was driven by a $10.8 billion gain in goods-producing industries and an $18.3 billion gain in services-producing industries. Manufacturing payrolls saw a strong rebound, rising $7.4 billion. Government wages rose modestly by $0.4 billion after being flat in November.\n\nOther income sources also improved. Rental income rose $8.2 billion, and asset income (interest and dividends) rose $9.3 billion, recovering from a decline in the previous month. Proprietors’ income increased $1.1 billion, reflecting gains in nonfarm income, while farm proprietors' income continued to fall. Personal current transfer receipts rose by $13.2 billion, bolstered by retroactive Social Security payments related to benefit recalculations.\n\nPersonal outlays declined by $5.2 billion in December, helping to boost the personal saving rate to 4.0%—up from 3.5% in November. Total personal saving rose to $460.1 billion, the highest level since September.\n\nInflation remained moderate. The PCE price index rose 0.1% in December, reversing a slight decline in November. Core PCE (excluding food and energy) rose 0.2%, suggesting mild underlying inflation pressures.\n\nFor the full year 2011, personal income rose 4.7%, up from 3.7% in 2010. However, real DPI growth slowed to 0.9% from 1.8%, indicating that inflation eroded much of the nominal gain. Real PCE grew 2.2% in 2011, slightly stronger than the 2.0% pace in 2010. December’s figures closed out the year with renewed income strength but subdued spending, as consumers remained cautious amid ongoing economic uncertainty."

Real PCE, however, rose just 0.1% in March, also slowing from 0.5% in February. The deceleration in real consumption reflects a pullback in durable goods spending, which fell 0.2% following a 2.1% surge in February due to earlier strength in auto sales.\n\nWage and salary disbursements increased $17.3 billion in March, down from February’s $24.1 billion gain. Within this, goods-producing payrolls fell by $1.3 billion, with manufacturing up only $0.1 billion. Services payrolls drove most of the gain, rising $18.6 billion.

Despite the income gains, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) edged down by $1.3 billion (less than 0.1%), following a $13.3 billion decline in May. The deceleration in spending coupled with income growth led to a sharp rise in the personal saving rate.\n\nReal disposable income increased 0.3% in June, slightly slower than May’s 0.5% gain. Real PCE, however, decreased 0.1%, reversing the previous month’s 0.1% increase. Consumers pulled back across categories: real purchases of nondurable goods fell 0.4%, services declined marginally, and durable goods were essentially flat.\n\nWage and salary disbursements were the primary driver of income growth, jumping $31.9 billion in June versus a $9.7 billion gain in May. Goods-producing industries rebounded with a $7.7 billion increase, led by a $5.7 billion rise in manufacturing payrolls. Services-producing industries also saw robust growth, contributing $24.2 billion. Government payrolls posted a modest $0.6 billion increase.\n\nOther income categories also expanded.

Real income growth outpaced spending, boosting savings. The quarter was also shaped by BEA’s annual NIPA revisions, which updated estimates back to 2009, incorporating new data and improved methodologies.

This spike was primarily driven by special and accelerated dividend payments, irregular bonuses, and retroactive social security benefits, all in anticipation of changes to individual income tax rates in 2013. In comparison, November also showed strong growth with personal income rising by $135.8 billion (1.0%) and DPI by $125.5 billion (1.0%).\n\nReal DPI, which adjusts for inflation, rose sharply by 2.8% in December, following a 1.3% increase in November. However, real PCE grew more modestly, increasing 0.2% in December, down from 0.6% in November, suggesting that much of the additional income was saved rather than spent.\n\nPrivate wages and salaries increased $44.0 billion in December, with $30.0 billion attributed to irregular pay such as year-end bonuses. Government payrolls increased $0.9 billion. In the asset income category, personal income receipts on assets exploded by $286.6 billion, led by a $291.0 billion surge in dividends as companies rushed to distribute payouts before expected tax hikes.\n\nOther contributors included a $6.4 billion rise in supplements to wages and salaries, a $9.3 billion increase in proprietors’ income, and an $8.9 billion gain in personal current transfer receipts. Notably, social security payments rose due to a retroactive adjustment.\n\nDespite a modest $22.6 billion (0.2%) increase in nominal PCE, the sharp income growth pushed the personal saving rate to 6.5%, up from 4.1% in November. Total personal saving rose to $805.2 billion from $495.0 billion.\n\nOn a real basis, spending increases were broad but muted: durable goods purchases rose 1.3%, nondurables 0.3%, and services 0.1%. Inflation remained low, with the overall PCE price index falling slightly (<0.1%) and the core index (excluding food and energy) ticking up less than 0.1%.\n\nFor the year 2012, personal income increased 3.5% (down from 5.1% in 2011), while DPI rose 3.3% and PCE rose 3.6%. Real DPI increased 1.5% and real PCE 1.9%, indicating steady but moderating real growth compared to 2011.\n\nIn summary, December’s extraordinary income spike reflects a one-time behavioral response to tax changes rather than a fundamental acceleration in wages or output. While this front-loading of income buoyed savings, it is unlikely to sustain future consumption trends without comparable follow-through in wages or policy incentives."

Real PCE also rose by 0.3% in both months, signaling steady but moderate real spending growth.\n\nThe March data reflect a normalization of income following large distortions from year-end 2012. In particular, income in January had plummeted due to the expiration of the payroll tax holiday and a reversal of special and accelerated income distributions in anticipation of tax rate changes. That volatility spilled over into early 2013, with February showing a large rebound and March returning to trend.\n\nPrivate wages and salaries increased $14.9 billion in March, down from $44.6 billion in February.

Rental income rose $2.1 billion, while asset-based income (interest and dividends) increased $3.1 billion. Transfer receipts also picked up, rising $2.9 billion after a flat reading in November. Contributions for government social insurance rose $0.7 billion.\n\nPersonal current taxes increased $6.0 billion, leaving DPI lower for the month. With personal outlays rising $42.0 billion (mainly driven by the $44.1 billion PCE increase), the personal saving rate fell to 3.9% from 4.3% in November.\n\nThe PCE price index rose 0.2% in December, slightly up from November’s sub-0.1% increase. Core PCE inflation (excluding food and energy) held steady at 0.1%.\n\nFor all of 2013, personal income rose 2.8%, slower than the 4.2% increase in 2012. DPI grew 1.9% (down from 3.9% in 2012), and PCE increased 3.1% (vs. 4.1% in 2012). Real DPI rose only 0.7%, compared with a 2.0% increase in 2012.

Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) decreased $19.0 billion, or 0.2 percent, marking a notable reversal from August when income and spending were both higher. Real DPI (adjusted for inflation) edged up by less than 0.1 percent in September, a slowdown from the 0.3 percent increase seen in August. Real PCE, a measure of inflation-adjusted household spending, declined by 0.2 percent in September, in contrast to a 0.5 percent gain in the previous month. This decline reflected a broad-based pullback in spending on durable and nondurable goods, partially offset by modest gains in services.\n\nPrivate wages and salaries increased $12.6 billion in September, down sharply from the $36.3 billion increase recorded in August. Within the private sector, goods-producing industries saw payrolls rise by only $0.7 billion, with manufacturing payrolls decreasing by $0.3 billion. Services-producing industries added $11.9 billion to payrolls, but this too was slower than the $31.4 billion increase the previous month. Government wages and salaries rose $1.4 billion in September, following a $0.9 billion increase in August.\n\nOther components of personal income showed mixed changes. Supplements to wages and salaries, which include employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds, increased by $3.5 billion in September, compared with a $5.2 billion increase in August. Proprietors' income decreased slightly by $0.8 billion, following a $9.9 billion decline in August. Farm proprietors’ income remained weak, falling $9.2 billion for the second consecutive month. However, nonfarm proprietors’ income rebounded, increasing by $8.4 billion after a $0.7 billion decline in August.\n\nRental income of persons rose by $1.5 billion, slowing from a $5.2 billion gain in the prior month. Personal income receipts on assets, including interest and dividend income, fell $1.1 billion in September, following a larger $2.5 billion drop in August. Meanwhile, personal current transfer receipts, which include government social benefits, increased by $7.5 billion, a slower pace than the $20.7 billion rise seen in August. Contributions for government social insurance, a subtraction in calculating personal income, increased by $1.8 billion in September, compared with a $5.1 billion increase in the prior month.\n\nPersonal current taxes increased by $7.0 billion in September, contributing to the relatively modest growth in DPI. Personal outlays, which include PCE, personal interest payments, and personal current transfer payments, fell by $14.5 billion in September after increasing by $63.4 billion in August. As a result, the personal saving rate rose to 5.6 percent in September from 5.4 percent in August, with total personal saving reaching $732.2 billion.\n\nReal PCE showed a notable shift in composition: purchases of durable goods fell 1.9 percent, reversing a 2.3 percent increase in August. This swing was driven primarily by motor vehicles and parts. Purchases of nondurable goods decreased 0.3 percent, compared with a 0.2 percent gain the prior month. In contrast, purchases of services increased 0.1 percent in September, slightly lower than the 0.4 percent increase in August. The PCE price index, a key measure of inflation, rose 0.1 percent in September after declining 0.1 percent in August. The core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy, also rose 0.1 percent, matching the previous month's increase.

Adjusted for inflation, real DPI rose 0.5%, improving from 0.4% the month prior. Real PCE declined 0.1% in December after a strong 0.7% increase in November, reflecting weaker consumer spending despite rising incomes. This deceleration was largely driven by lower durable goods purchases, especially motor vehicles.\n\nWage and salary disbursements slowed significantly, rising only $6.9 billion in December versus $42.2 billion in November. Private wages increased $4.9 billion, sharply down from a $40.6 billion gain in November, while government wages rose $1.9 billion, slightly more than the prior month’s $1.7 billion.

For instance, real DPI in August was revised down from a 0.1% gain to flat (0.0%), and real PCE from a 0.0% change to a -0.2% decline. These downward revisions reflect updated source data and slightly weaker consumer momentum over the late summer months.\n\nOverall, the Q3 data ended with a modest uptick in consumer activity after a subdued August.

Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) climbed $63.1 billion (0.5%). Adjusted for inflation, real DPI increased 0.1% and real PCE increased 0.3%. The PCE price index rose 0.2%, with core PCE (excluding food and energy) also increasing 0.1%. Year-over-year, the PCE price index rose 1.6%, and core inflation held steady at 1.7%.\n\nThe income gain in December was driven primarily by increases in wages and salaries, personal current transfer receipts, and rental income. On the consumption side, the rise in real PCE reflected higher spending on durable goods and services. December’s 0.5% increase in nominal PCE came after a modest 0.2% gain in November. Notably, durable goods spending rebounded, contributing significantly to real consumption growth.\n\nPersonal outlays rose $66.4 billion in December, while personal saving reached $768.4 billion, resulting in a personal saving rate of 5.4%, up slightly from 5.3% in November. Despite stronger consumer spending, income growth outpaced outlays, nudging savings upward.\n\nAnnual data for 2016 show that personal income grew 3.5%, a slowdown from the 4.4% growth in 2015. DPI matched the prior year’s pace, rising 3.8%. PCE also increased 3.8%, up from 3.5% in 2015. In real terms, DPI rose 2.7% and real PCE increased 2.7%, both slightly below 2015’s growth rates of 3.5% and 3.2%, respectively.\n\nThis release included revised estimates for October and November. Personal income in October was revised slightly downward, while November saw upward revisions to both personal income and consumption. Specifically, real DPI for November was revised from a -0.1% decline to flat, and real PCE was revised up to 0.2%. Overall, the final quarter of 2016 reflected moderate growth in income and spending, alongside stable inflation."

Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) edged up just $5.7 billion, registering less than 0.1% growth. Adjusted for inflation, real DPI saw a notable rise of 0.5%, and real PCE rose 0.3%. This was driven by a 0.2% decline in the PCE price index and a 0.1% drop in core PCE (excluding food and energy).\n\nThe modest increase in nominal personal income was primarily attributed to gains in government social benefits, nonfarm proprietors’ income, and employee compensation. On the expenditure side, real PCE growth was powered by higher spending on services, particularly household utilities, though spending on durable goods fell due to reduced outlays for motor vehicles and parts.\n\nOverall personal outlays in March increased $4.9 billion. With income growth outpacing outlays, personal saving climbed to $849.1 billion. The personal saving rate ticked up to 5.9% of DPI, highlighting continued caution among consumers amid slower consumption growth.\n\nRevisions to prior months show slightly weaker growth than initially reported. January’s personal income growth was revised down from 0.5% to 0.4%, and February’s from 0.4% to 0.3%. Real PCE in January was revised down from -0.2% to -0.3%, and February’s real PCE from -0.1% to -0.1%. The combination of muted consumption and steady income gains has lifted inflation-adjusted saving, while inflation itself moderated in March, with the PCE price index slowing year-over-year to 1.8% (from 2.1% in February) and core PCE down to 1.6%."

The PCE price index registered negligible change, while the core PCE index (excluding food and energy) increased 0.1%.\n\nThe drop in personal income was driven by declines in personal dividend and interest income, partly reversing strong gains in May. This was offset somewhat by an increase in employee compensation. On the spending side, real PCE rose $4.5 billion, driven by a $10.0 billion increase in services—especially health care—while spending on nondurable goods declined $4.4 billion and durable goods fell $2.3 billion. Gasoline was a major factor behind the decline in goods consumption.\n\nPersonal outlays grew by $14.1 billion in June, while personal saving declined, resulting in a saving rate of 3.8%, the lowest in several quarters.

The PCE price index climbed 0.5% and the core PCE index, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.4%. Year-over-year, the headline PCE inflation rate held steady at 4.0%, and the core rate was 3.5%.\n\nThe increase in personal income was driven primarily by gains in compensation of employees, particularly private wages and salaries. Meanwhile, government social benefits declined as economic impact payments and Pandemic Unemployment Compensation continued to wane. Within PCE, the $29.3 billion increase in goods spending was led by nondurable goods—especially pharmaceuticals and gasoline—while durable goods declined due to reduced motor vehicle and parts purchases. The $126.1 billion increase in services spending was broad-based, led by food services and accommodations.\n\nPersonal outlays increased $158.7 billion in June, while the personal saving rate decreased to 9.4% from prior months. The data reflects a continued shift in household behavior as the economy reopens and government stimulus winds down."

This marked the sharpest drop in DPI since early 2021, primarily due to the expiration of major pandemic-related federal support programs. In contrast, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased $93.4 billion (0.6%), driven by a 0.3% rise in real PCE. Real DPI fell 1.6%. The PCE price index rose 0.3% in September and the core PCE index, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2%. Year-over-year, PCE inflation hit 4.4%, with core inflation at 3.6%.\n\nThe decline in income reflected reductions in government social benefits, particularly in unemployment insurance and other transfers such as Provider Relief Fund payments and PPP loan disbursements. Unemployment-related payments from pandemic programs—including PUC, PEUC, and PUA—sharply declined.\n\nSpending growth was led by a $63.6 billion increase in services (notably health care and food services), while goods rose $29.9 billion, with gains in nondurable goods like pharmaceuticals and gasoline. Durable goods declined due to lower motor vehicle purchases. Personal outlays rose $92.1 billion, while personal saving fell to $1.34 trillion, bringing the saving rate down to 7.5%."

However, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) declined by $95.2 billion (0.6%), reflecting a sharp pullback in spending on goods. Real DPI fell 0.2%, while real PCE declined 1.0%, driven by a 3.1% drop in goods spending, partially offset by a 0.1% rise in services.

On a year-over-year basis, headline PCE inflation reached 5.8% and core inflation 4.9%.\n\nThe increase in income was primarily due to higher wages and salaries in both private and government sectors. This was partially offset by declines in both farm and nonfarm proprietors’ income and the continued wind-down of pandemic-related government social benefits. The drop in PCE was led by broad declines in goods spending—especially for recreational goods, newspapers, and home furnishings—while spending on services rose, with health care being the main contributor.\n\nPersonal outlays decreased $93.5 billion in December, and the personal saving rate ticked up to 7.9%, with total savings at $1.44 trillion. These figures highlight a continued shift in consumer behavior amid ongoing COVID-related uncertainty and elevated inflation pressures."

The uptick in benefits was primarily attributed to Medicare and Medicaid outlays.\n\nThe strong $185.0 billion growth in nominal PCE was split between $114.6 billion in services and $70.4 billion in goods. Services growth was driven by increases in travel-related and food service spending, while within goods, nondurables such as gasoline and energy goods rose, offsetting a decline in durable goods, particularly motor vehicles.
